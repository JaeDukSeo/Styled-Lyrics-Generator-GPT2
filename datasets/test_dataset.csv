Sword in my hand, I fight like this
And I'm more than a man, I'm a god
Bitch, touché, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop
Out of that tank top and bra
And when I say ""Doo-doo, doo-doo,"" bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this
I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, I'm forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down
Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!

Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana
Function on fire, burn the roof off this mothafucka
Psych ward is ballin', go craze like no other
Weed steady blowin', pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'
Faded, faded, faded, right?
Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no, it's not the Westside
Stick it up your SoutHside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year

Reggae,ScHoolboy Q,2012,Habits & Contradictions,Blessed,"What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say

Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like ""It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight""
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
""Fuck police"" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son

Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here

Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all

Blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah"

After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court

Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel

I'm apocalypse to your politics
Might cop the Phantom, get ghost
I can pay your bills with this coat
Need an extra band for this smoke
I can see for miles with this scope, nigga
Got an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer
Misses Piggy, want a piggyback
Rock cremation, then called it crack
I'mma keep on eating 'til my ankles fat
Sell that fix, throw it cross the map
Push my penis in between her lap
Put my semen all down her throat
'Til Tito kilos come off that boat

This the shit that they want

Yeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow
Speeding through the yellow lights
Treat my Versace belt like it's a mistletoe
I put everything over yellow rice
Graduated from hella ice
If I stand on my bankroll (stand on your bankroll)
Nigga, I'd be scared of heights
And I'd be dodging the po-lice
When I was poor with no lights
When I was poor with potential
Watch my flow in four inches
Oh Lord, she in Christians
All gold for my Adventist
Pulled it down and she kissed it
All gold where my wrists is
God'll judge, no conviction
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted
Moving my whip down the boulevard
Word 'round town, I was selling hard
Hard and I'm talking bout the yayo
Hit her on the floor and then I lay low
Amigos say ""Que pasa with the pesos?""
Promethazine codeine, caseloads (T.R.U.)
And when I pull up to the valet
You know I got the strippers on payroll!

This that shit that's Iraq
This that make you climax
This that shit you just bought
This that Q go hamhawk
This that car that won't park
Pedal to floor, it won't stop
And just when you thought it won't drop
Oxymoron in stores
Come in, kids, lock the door
Knock-knock-knock, hit the floor
Need my bread off the top
Could buy anything off the lot
This that steel, not the grill
Get them slugs off for real
This that curl with the gel
We gon' win, smoke the L's
She love my mic, rock the bell
Leave that punani killed
All them hoes run to Q
Spit that truth,make the loot
Expensive whips, we hotbox
Spent 2 bills on my socks
This that make you cockblock

Prescription drugs, show me love
Percocets, Adderall
Xanny bars, get codeine involved
Stuck in this body high, can't shake it off
I'm falling off, I can't hold a thought
What's wrong with me? Now depression creep
I'm stressing deep, even in my sleep
My mommy call, I hit ignore
My daughter calls, I press ignore
My chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor
I'm blanking out, woke up on the couch
Dinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts
I had a ball sellin' 80s but yo, the karma's worse
I cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved
My senses harmed, sluggish ruggish
A couple Xannies popped, open my pill box (Prescription drugs)

What's wrong, daddy?!
Wake up!
Wake up!

Prescription drugs, I fell in love
My little secret, she gon' kill a thug
My body numb, she like to give me hugs
I love her touch, I get a rush
When she don't come around, I start to go nuts
My heart erupts, I'm curled in pain
My phone ring, ring and ring and ring
If you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing
May 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6:45, I finally answer this time
He said ""Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes""
I don't decline, at least that's in my mind
Grab the keys, need some woods for the trees
Dap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC
Continue right, remember seeing light
Wise night, but that's my life (Prescription drugs)

You tired?
You mad?
Okay, I love you, daddy

Without the injections, do the same love and affection
How could they say feeling good is an addiction?
But the world is full of shit, so I don't listen
In fact ""We living to die"" is a contradiction
So trapping in a Nissan, O-X-Y, I keep 'em, O-X-Y, you need one

Fuck punching in
Throwing rocks, no hopscotch
Bet my 9 milli' hit the right spot
Bang!... Last night it was a dream
This morning a fantasy back when the only fan I had was a fiend
(Huhhuhhuh-huhhuh!)
Meet me by the Acura, cause the cops like
To get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea
But it's cool, I've been catching on to they formula
See I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'
Then rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo
The bad guy, never once been a ho's hero
He get zero, I said nada, bitch pass the 'cama (Uh, yeah)

La-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)
Fuck with one of my real niggas

I done jumped up off my ass
Hit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him

But... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)
But... Me Glock clock familia (Boom)

Find a nigga realer than me, my socks stink (yeah)
Eat so much pussy that my mustache pink
Strapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt, gangsta lean help
Hoodie on backwards, with the eyes cut out
My hate felt my .45 elder, poetry's deep
I never fail ya, ScHoolboy bust flame
Orange-yellow higher than Margielas, since a young nigga
I admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal
From his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout
Think about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday
He still get a hit, whether jacking radios or sucking dick
Sell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips
Cause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much
To get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work
Unless we rewind, and answer my church
Times getting harder, than my dick on a growth spurt
Around the same time, all you niggas was on purp, my sober ass Was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck
Freeze! Give me the keys, extra Fritos, chili and
Cheese! Threw some Baby Lucas in his eyes, before I
Leave! The cops'll never get the lead, grandma taught me well
And my uncle gun, was the accessory, 211 sipping, plus a robbery
This little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome

I done jumped up off my ass
Hit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen

But... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)
But... Meet Glock clock familia (Boom)

Grandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more
She always got me things, that we couldn't afford
The new Js and Tommy Hill in my drawers
Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, see Golden Eye was away at war
We wasn't thinking of getting money then
Nor did I wonder why, my uncle done sold his Benz
Cause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down
I also notice moms be locking doors, when he around
But anyways, his wife done left him and now he living with us
My bike is missing, Grandma like to hide her check every month
My uncle's nuts, he used to give me whiskey to piss in cups
Knocking on the door telling me to ""Hurry up!"", he in a rush
I gave it to him, then got my ass whipped for doing it
Moms used to tell me like, ""Nigga, know who you dealing with.""
Them was the good days ,'til I was raised the older ways
Rat-Tone, my nigga's brother showed me my first K
I was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back
He called us over like - HEY!
YAWK, YAWK, YAWK, YAWK! We like -""Daaaaaamn, nigga""
Then again - YAWK, YAWK! We like, ""Daaaaaamn, nigga!""
Hearing him say ""Cuz'"", turned us to a faaaaaan, nigga!
Later on he got locked, so now we're taking his fades
Continue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page
Gangbanging was a ritual and Grandma would help
She should've never left her gun on the shelf
This little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome

I done jumped up off my ass
Hit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling

Strays through your living room
Liable to drive-by on a summer day
July 4th will be in June

Coke go in the pot, arm and hammer body
A$AP Rocky, want it I could get it
Onion in my pocket like the booty on a midget
Diamond on my rollie, teach a nigga how to fridge it
Looking at the times, they been winning for a minute
See my neck, co-defendant, what's the problem?
Seen the souls long gone before I got them

Follow me, I can show you what these streets like, nigga
Handle bars of a Schwinn, guns blow like dusty winds
Spend a band, push his wig back when that revolver spins
Toe tag 'em, false flagging like it's all good
Tell niggas tee off like Tiger Woods, where you from?

Few years later I'm really from it, we were still kids
Crack off nigga, I'm squeezing empty 'til the shell break
Fuck my image, I need the drop, I need the Blank Face

Cause brain damage from my mechanics, keeping two ways
Sell narcotics, I'm slanging diamonds with your pack then
Stack large commas, you with your riders with your backbone
Can't fold figures, I make deposits with the gold grin
Jeans look dirty, I lift the Chevy with the rims on
All bad bitches, they wanna fuck me with the cap gone
Real life nigga, I'm in the stu' 'til all the weed blown
Wait long, long, I hid the dope behind the cellphone

Crack the pig bank, robbin' your kids too

Die now, go to Heaven, or bring 'em through
Lot of brown 'round here, got that white girl for you
And she swimming in fire water, could be double digits
Pistol through your Civic
Most die before they hear it, turn a nigga to a spirit
Drive slow, oh, hey, hit the curb with shattered mirrors
Look around now you're hell bound, boogie down
Bullshit I won't allow, slang a bird every hou'
Smack a nigga with the heat, contradicting, now you peace

Holding a .38 and a shotgun

Running with the rebels
It's a three-man weave with the Lord and the devil
Really all I need is a pitchfork and a shovel
If I can't proceed then I resort to the metal (Blank Face)

Came from the dirt to the carrots
Getting dirty dollars, four different baby mommas
Dope between the speakers, so fuck you, Mr. Teacher
'Cause the paper, I ace it, lead, they tried to erase it
But I'm still standing, they mad and everything
Nothing given, I'ma take it first
On the trees like a hammock, flip the work behind the campus
Young Groovy turn your hood into a movie (into a movie...)
Gang bangin', dope slangin'
GTA-ing, shoot the whole club up
Fuck tryna sneak the K in, on the road to riches

Say money be the root of evil, look around and see what it do to people
Veins full of heroin using pcp inject the body with a needle
Lord help us, swear to god, dope dealers, get a job
Keep it real this shit ain't really cool, being in a cell, you ain't alive
Niggas quick to show out over cheese, love to help the devil do a deed
So I rather bust of them keys? yeah nigga birds and the beez

I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change

Q I wanna see you do your thang
Entertainment business living limelight
Hop on every track and move them trains
Show these motherfuckers that you been tight, then they ever been
Its evident that you intelligent but you can't escape that life
And for you my nigga
I would sacrifice myself to make it just to see you hold the mic
And hit the stage and rock the set
But its hard to change when your from the sect
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death
Life of crack I’d like to hang you by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them run way jets
Fly to Singapore one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to god, its hard out here for a young black men to live
If you dont do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
My nigga won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter
Please dont let her grow up life without a father
Look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy
All she need is love, put that shit aside
At the same time know they got to eat
Know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HGC, no a.c
And the block hot, you keep runnin', cop say freeze
Blue pill, red pill, choose now, birds or the beez

Reggae,ScHoolboy Q,2014,Oxymoron,Blind Threats,"Right, uh, same shit every day, homie
Lord, please forgive me for all my sins
Yeah, nigga wake up to the same shit every day, homie
Walking in the valley of the shadow of death, no rules, right

Washing my sins off in hell's water
Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em
Kneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me?

But if God won't help me, this gun will
I swear I'm gon' find my way

Uh, four corners
Cat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch
High on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet
Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more
Trapping, trying to make it out this obstacle
Life on the edge, hell a block away
Pretty Snow White turned eight today
Selling that base, no Dr. Dre
Uh, guess who in the building?
Bucket hat with a strap like a pilgrim
Uh, kneeling down with some questions to address like
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?
The Ten Commandments, I can mark five checks
But I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats
Streets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex
Faith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet
Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests
From the cop raid, all can relate from the streets
To the wall from niggas to compadres
When the sun go down, I'm predicting a heatwave
Forecast your whole body, heat on, room full of homies
I just pray that the Lord got me

But if God won't help me, this gun will
I swear I'm gon' find my way
Mic check, mic check, mic check
La-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low
La-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low
But if God won't help me, this gun will
I swear I'm gon' find my way

Aim that, shoot that, pledge allegiance
Kill mine, kill yours, make it even
Soul need saving, Mr. Preacher
I know I only come around when it's Easter
Funerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time
When I'm in jail or when my card declined
Uh, will you answer me?
Take me out of hell and make plans for me?
Misery loves company, ain't a surprise
It was just me and my niggas, we was trying to survive
But we would never make it out alive
Shit, we living to die—oxymoron
Hope to get to heaven 'til that day arrive
Running through the ally, hope the bullet don't collide
Car window shattered, glass on my right side
Dogs bark in the backyard, root for me
Out of shape belly, courtesy of 40
Spoiled only child, baby boy Jody
Same jacket on from back in the day
Praying that the Lord come and take me away

But if God won't help me, this gun will
I swear I'm gon' find my way
Mic check, mic check, mic check
La-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low

I swear I'm gon' find my way

Ayo, tuna fish sandwiches bread, dry and stinking
Black Lincoln, burgundy Mac, I clap a king-pin
Caught me in the airport dusted that I was thinking
On how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances
Yeah, money is the issue, I diss you
It's no problem at all, yo, the bunch on the pistol
Cause I'm a suitcase king
Cooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin
New Beige Bent, we stay winning, play it again, yo
Put the bone in your jaw, now say it again
Round nightfall under the tents, coming to rinse
Get out the way or let the shotty dispense
Revenge killers who make the events iller
This is more realer, snatch you right up out of the Benz
The Wu wheelers who huddle up, coupes knows the truth
You know the whoopty-whoop, solo or group, I kill niggas"
Reggae,ScHoolboy Q,2011,Setbacks,Fantasy,"We can have a rendezvous

I'm 'bout to take a hit, shit
Damn, start a fam
Take you to the crib, show you how I live
Need you by my side, you could be my rib
Your friends messy, baby, I could be your bib
Fool for your love

My little ghetto dove
Hold me down and I could take us up

You that nigga, you that nigga
Real go-getter and I'm that bitch
So you better come get her

She wonder where we're going next
Want a rider if you know what's best
I can be your iron knight and you I will protect
Inhale your love and let our souls connect
Go deep inside
Steal your heart, take away your pride
Can see it in your eyes
The way a gangsta got you smiling took you by surprise
Got me smiling too
No waiter, girl, you are the menu
My number one fan, you are the venue
Fuck show money, rather you're my revenue
Smoke a blunt or two
Gaze at the stars, keep us hypnotized
Reach for the sky
I could take you to the top, I hope you do comply

You that nigga, you that nigga
Real go-getter and I'm that bitch
So you better come get her

We can have a rendezvous
Butter on your crip legs, dinner for two
Later on, shit, let's see what it do
Been chasing you for a while, let's end the pursuit
Lock you down and throw away the key
My new life the only place for you to be
Glad you chose a G
I can be your dreams and fulfill your fantasy

You that nigga, you that nigga
Real go-getter and I'm that bitch
So you better come get her"

With my little China doll, got my back like spinal cord
That pistol on me, yeah that .45
Nigga feeling do or die, fuck tryna be unified
She over there, wanna be over here
So I pull her hair, fuck her from the rear until she there
How are you? Shit, I go by Q
Hey ho, now what it do?
Got a king size and it's built for 2
I been meaning to be leaning up in that pussy
Like Promethazine and she took the semen my willy beaming
On any given Sunday that pussy a runway
She did it the fun way, smash it like Ticante
She did me hombre no need for nombre, we screaming olé and olé
We scored no goalie, she's just a groupie
And group-a, gave top like toupée, bum rushed that coochie
Her pussy lukewarm like long lay, her head be Bombay
Like gin and OJ, took a shot, and I won like gameday
Yes I'm the sensei, comprende? Got a ticket, one way
Oh, you don't really see it that I'm gone?
Pass the baton, black, real rap, spit to the break of the dawn

Nigga this Black Hippy, nothing else, beat so bake I'm 'bout to melt
All my shit be prison felt, TDE we got the belt

Still mobbing the 7/11, fuck a car
Top Dawg, ya little fists ain't up to par
Got the baddest hoes, burn the finest kush
That means I'm a botanist slash gynecologist
Please hold your apologies for sleeping, it was prophecy
I just need some time and let these demons climb up out of me
You know the ones that got me sipping these mickeys 'til I'm numb
Having your missis' tongue missing from her mouth, in around my nuts
Ring around the rosie, pocket full of dust bunnies
This hip hop ain't done none for me
Knew I was to be a star when I had a cubby
Watching Ferngully, now everything I puff fluffy and I'm so comfy
Watch the company I keep in case they come for me

Underage, smokin' weed and alcohol
Grandma sweeped shells out the driveway
One of the homies got slayed so we bang at the King parade
I can take you spots where gangsters walk
The real damus and locs, Boyz N the Hood wasn't even close
Where the girls' kitten show, hit the dope and the pussy soaked

In granny's plastic suede couch
Best play cat and that mouse
A minor pitchin' in major
Stay servin' dope but we cater
Take you back to my Sega
Slammin' bones on that table
Runnin' errands for grams, the paramedics at Tam's
Forced to grow to a man
Before L.A. had them Rams
Went to school for the bitches, where scorin' drugs was the goal
Lungs black as a crow, got banned from every hood store
My haters came for the better and money came for the loads
Concrete where we rose, you wasn't built from this mold
Fucked up the game with many flow
I've been a loc since embryo

I do this shit for lifers way before
Jehri curls, cut Dickies and sherm smoke
Got so many bodies the world knows, shit

Got a sack of marijuana, think I'm 'bout to bend a corner

Check the forecast, it's Wavy Q, I should make the news
My fortune said that I'll be pimping you and your pussy juice
Super sweet, sell a trick a treat, hope your lips in shape
Cause you worked your feet as you stroll them streets, beeper checking
Hope no cops arresting, girl, I told you them narcs be pressing
Better act like you a pedestrian and don't mention my name
My pimping is game, cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain
Come pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling
On 51st and Figg, grew up about ten minutes from the real Ricky
Where the shoelaces is orange with H hats like we from Houston
Condoms in hoes' purses with baby wipes for they coochie
You's a ho that's selling booty, no need to be acting bougie
Bitch, I give your ass a noogie and a chicken nugget
And make you watch me at the movies, I'm panoramic
My filming be rated pimping, my mink dragging
With two bitches that go and get it, my hoes get it

Uh-huh, yeah, watch me go Black Forest ham
A new school player laced with the old gift gab
And don't let your Shark Week mouth override your Green Goldfish ass
So for every ho you clown, I'mma crown two
And anything good hurts and I cried
Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my mothafuckin' face
Or I choose to not do this around you
See ho you like a brain aneurysm
Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em
Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs
No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom
Yeah, P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play
And the hard head that make a soft ass played out
Will forgive and forget yesterday
Now get 'em, Q, a pimp on foot, go to sleep carless, wake up to a Cadillac
Remember Forrest Gump walked and he was pretty stupid
So you know what? Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world
P, cause that ho only yours as long as she hoeing
But Happy Pimping and Merry Ho Ho
Keep an eye on bottom bitch too
Cause that bitch'll run a ho or two off, mane
Pimps only fuck with pimps, homie, that's why we so solid
Red to blue, to debt, to due, it's easier
To put a watermelon through the eye of a needle
This is done by choice, not by force
I ain't asking, I'm telling you

Reggae,Tom T. Hall,1975,I Wrote a Song About It ,I Like Beer,"In some of my songs I have casually mentioned
The fact that I like to drink beer
This little song is more to the point
Roll out the barrel and lend me your ears

I like beer it makes me a jolly good fellow
I like beer it helps me unwind
And sometimes it makes me feel mellow
(Makes him feel mellow)

Whiskey's too rough, champagne costs too much
Vodka puts my mouth in gear
This little refrain should help me explain
As a matter of fact I like beer
(He likes beer)

My wife often frowns when we're out on the town
And I'm wearing a suit and a tie
She's sipping vermouth and she thinks I'm uncouth
When I yell as the waiter goes by



Last night I dreamed that I passed from the scene
And I went to a place so sublime
Oh, the water was clear and tasted like beer
Then they tur
Ned it all into wine"
Reggae,Tom T. Hall,1971,In Search of a Song ,The Year That Clayton Delaney Died,"Well I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did
Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around
I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me
Never took his guitar and made it down in Tennessee
Daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band
Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
There ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early grave
I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half stoned pickin` up the Lovesick Blues
When Clayton died I made him a promise
I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now
I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
Well I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
But it could be that the good Lord likes a little picking too
Yeah I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died"
Reggae,Tom T. Hall,1968,Ballad Of Forty Dollars And His Other Great Songs ,Ballad of Forty Dollars,"The man who preached the funeral
Said it really was a simple way to die
He laid down to rest one afternoon
And never opened up his eyes
They hired me and Fred and Joe
To dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours
And I guess we must've drunk a case of beer
I guess I ought to go and watch them put him down
But I don't own a suit
And anyway when they start talkin' about
The fire in Hell, well, I get spooked
So, I'll just sit here in my truck
And act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway, when they're all through
I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Well, here they come and who's that
Ridin' in that big ol' shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome, I do believe
That that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his great uncle
Someone said he owned a big ol' farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down
And look it over, that won't do no harm
Well, that must be the widow in the car
And would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress
You know, some women do look good in black
Well, he's not even in the ground
And they say that his truck is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard
But you can't tell too much behind the veil
Well, listen, ain't that pretty
When the bugler plays the Military Taps
I think that when you's in the war
They always hide 'n play a song like that
Well, here I am and there they go
And I guess you'd just call it my bad luck
I hope he rests in peace, the trouble is
The fellow owes me forty bucks"
Reggae,Tanya Tucker,2019,While I’m Livin’,Bring My Flowers Now,"So I said, ""Listen, I got..."" and I said, uh, somethin' about, uh, goin' to somebody's funeral or something. She... I said, ""Man,"" I said, I said, ""Bring my flowers now, while I'm living""

Bring my flowers now, while I'm living
I won't need your love when I'm gone
Don't spend time, tears, or money
On my old breathless body
If your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on

All the miles cast a long shadow
I'd take a couple back if I could
I'd have learned to play guitar
Tell my daddy more I loved him
But I believe, for the most part, I done good

There's always sunrise and rainbows and babies
And the little things I cherish on my way
Even though one day
They'll bury me and Jesse Ray
I just know we're gonna ride again someday

Bring my flowers now, while I'm living
I won't need your love when I'm gone
Don't spend time, tears, or money
On my ol' breathless body
Well, if your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on

The days are long, but the years are lightning
They're bright and they will never strike again
I wish I'd been a better friend
A better daughter to my mother
There's no going back when your back's against the wind

So if you got love, then you're sittin' on a gold mine
And you can't take it with you when you go
So don't wait to help your sister
Forgive your brother and your neighbor
We all think we've got the time until we don't

Bring my flowers now, while I'm living
I won't need your love when I'm gone
Don't spend time, tears, or money
On my old breathless body
If your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on
If your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on"

What's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
She's forty-one
And her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks round Brownsville say she's crazy
Cause she walks downtown
With her suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark haired man
In her younger days
They called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree
Stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride

Reggae,Tanya Tucker,2019,While I’m Livin’,The Wheels of Laredo,"On a winter night in Webb County, Texas
On the north bank of the mighty Rio Grande
I was watchin' the jungle fires a-burnin'
Across the border of a not-so-distant land
And the echoes of the church bells that were swingin'
Could be heard from Guadalupe Market Square
There was a girl down there on the south side of the river
She had feathers tied into her long black hair

And if I was I was white-crowned sparrow
Well, I would float upon the southern skies of blue
But I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you

I put on my favorite jacket for Jamboozie
I painted up my eyes and wore my beads
There was a band playin' ""To God Be the Glory""
There were people dancin' all around the street
There were barrels on the sidewalk that were burnin'
And a fortune-teller readin' people's hands
And I swear, I heard those church bells ringin'
'Cross the border of a not-so-distant land

Singing, if I was white-crowned sparrow
Well, I would float upon the southern skies of blue
But I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you
And if I was I was white-crowned sparrow
Well, I would float upon the southern skies of blue

Now, you can keep my tears and my good years
And your Sears and Roebuck ring
And I'll take this show on down the road

A retired family man
With a younger wife than our own son
And a cat that you can't stand

Small change and loose ends
She only regrets that she might've been
A little faster on the draw

They're anywhere the wind blows
She's been to hell and Texas
And she knows how it feels
To be ridin' that hot streak
And drunk on some back street
Falling off the wagon
And under the wheels

Time was when she was queen
Now the rodeo's just this old girl's dream
The highs are few and far between
The lows get the rest
These old hard times ain't nothin' new
Once you've done the best you can do
You just tip your hat to the wild and blue
And you ride off to the west

Those old high ridin' heroes

Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where they did their homework and learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know underneath that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

I cut out pictures of houses for years
From Better Homes and Garden magazines
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
But once the kids were grown, it was just too much for me

This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself again
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave

And the Hollywood Hills
Where the desert fades into the L.A. sky
Where the palm trees are a-reachin'
And the holy devil's preachin'
To people blinded by the stars behind their eyes

To be roamin' like a gypsy
And livin' on the edge
Sometimes your loneliness, it comes with throttle
And happiness, it seems
Just like our golden dreams
Won't be found at the bottom of a bottle

Let me feel your breath again
Take me back to the place your love did find me
Black ribbon, lead me home
Wherever I may roam
And may the bridges that I cross not burn behind me

From the west coast to the east
I cursed the worn-out stars as they were falling
I got tossed and turned around
But I always stood my ground
I still hear the winds of Seminole a-calling

Let me feel your breath again
Take me back to the place your love did find me

I looked at her like this ain't nonthing but a car
If you ride with them you ain't going that far
But if you ride with me, crib so big we can play hide-and-seek
You can confide to me, ride me like I ride the beat

Drop her ass at the Chocolate Factory (yeah)
We did them 12 Play's (yeah)
And you know who you is girl
We been fuckin' since the 12th grade, goddamn

This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt

This is my story - money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y

And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it

Pull up to the club at about three
I'm killin' it, guilty no plea
I'm leaving out at 6 with a dime piece
By 9 o'clock, we on round three
I speak of rain they say I'm crazy like they didn't know
See I'm not crazy but my talent, man, got bipolar
Say she's a church girl but man she's blowing holy smokes
Showed her the Jesus piece now she got the Holy Ghost
They asked them in a interview, ""why do he love these girls?""
The only thing he had to say was, ""motherfuck the world!""

This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt

There are miracles in life I must achieve

Reggae,R. Kelly,2005,TP.3: Reloaded,Trapped in the Closet Chapter 1,"Seven o'clock in the morning
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretching and yawning
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, ""Good morning, darling"" from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face like what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here 'til the morning sun?
Must have lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, ""You can't go this way""
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, ""Woman, move out my way""
Said, ""I got a wife at home""
She said, ""Please don't go out there""
""Lady, I've got to get home""
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs
""Shh, shh, quiet, hurry up and get in the closet""
She said, ""Don't you make a sound, or some shit is going down""
I said, ""Why don't I just go out the window?""
""Yes, except for one thing, we on the fifth floor""
""Shit, think, shit, think, shit, quick, put me in the closet""
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
And he walks in and yells, ""I'm home""
She says ""Honey I'm in the room""
He walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', ""Honey, I've been missin' you""
She hops all over him and says ""I've cooked and ran your bathwater""
I'm telling you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed and starts to snatching her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it, but things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, ""There’s a mystery going on
And I'm going to solve it""
And I'm like, ""God please, don't let this man open this closet""
He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, ""Baby, come back to bed""
He says, ""Bitch, say no more""
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed (bed)
Then under the dresser (dresser)
He looks at the closet (closet)
I pull out my Beretta (Beretta)
He walks up to the closet (closet)
Get closer to the closet (closet)
Now he's at the closet (closet)
Now he’s opening the closet (closet, closet, closet...)"

(To every city)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(Every hood)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(And every block)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(Ghetto America!)

Rolling through the hood, just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know that your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed, going on four long years
I'm still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days you used to talk to me
Smiling while I'm sipping on this Hennessy
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Now ever since this money come, ut's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say, ""Boy, you've been blessed""
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shooting this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass players get a real player hating 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And, boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride

How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of a tragic end
Damn, my condolences

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies land
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans?

And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And, boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Instead of you all throwing them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face

His phone goes off and then things get a little more interesting
He steps a little closer
I point my gun and says, ""I'm not the one you after""
He says, ""Something I bet you didn't know my man
Did she tell you that I was a pastor?""
I said, ""Well good that's better, right
Why can't we handle this Christian-like?""
And I started to put the gun down
'Til I saw his face still had that frown
She started crying, saying ""Baby, I'm sorry""
Then he said, ""Baby not as sorry as you're gonna be""
I started inching out
He says, ""No, I want you to see this""
Said, ""I gotta get out this house""
He said, ""Not 'til I reveal my secret""
I'm like ""What is going on inside his head?""
Then he takes his phone and calls somebody up and says
""Hello"" (hello?) baby (aha)
“Turn the car around” (what’s going on over there?)
Listen I just need for you to get right back here now"" (click)
He looks at me and says, ""Well since we're all coming out the closet
I'm not about to be the only one that's brokenhearted""
And she said, ""What do you mean?""
And he said, ""Just wait and see""
I said, ""Somebody better talk to me""
And then his phone rings
He picks up and somebody says ""Sweetheart, I'm downstairs""
And he's like ""I'll buzz you up
I'm on the fifth floor, hurry take the stairs""
And I'm like, ""Who is this mystery lady that you're talking to?""
He says, ""In time you both will know the shocking truth
Baby, this is something I've been wanting to get off my chest for a long, long time""
Then I said, ""Nigga, I'ma shoot you both
If you don't say what's on your mind""
He said ""wait, I hear somebody comin' up the stairs""
And I'm lookin' at the door
He says, ""I think you better sit down in the chair""
I says, ""I'm gonna count to four""
""1..."" he says, ""Mister, wait!""
""2..."", she says, ""Please don't shoot""
""3..."", he says, ""Don't shoot me""
""4..."", she screams
Then a knock on the door, the gun's in my hand
He opens the door, I can't believe it's a man
(Man… man… man…)"
Reggae,R. Kelly,2005,TP.3: Reloaded,Trapped in the Closet Chapter 5,"And now, I'm like
""Well, well, well, what the fuck is this?
A condom in my bed
You better start talking, fucking bitch
'Fore I take a match and burn this motherfucker down""
I said, ""You better start talking
And start talking right god damn now""
Then she said, ""Baby, I'm so speechless""
Then I said, ""My baby, you gon' be breathless
If ya don't start talking quick
Woman, I'm gon' have a fit
You don't know what ya fucking with
Girl ya better cut the bullshit
Now it's obvious somebody has been all up in my home
In my bed, and plus I smell cigarettes.""
Now I'm sniffing and looking around
Suspicious like someone's here
And then I looked in her eyes
And in her eyes there was so much fear
Pull out my gun said, ""Is he still here?""
She shook her head and said nah
I'm checking behind every door
She cried out, ""He left right after you called.""
I said, ""What the fuck was you thinking?
Thought that I wouldn’t find this out?
Then I said you must be crazy or
On crack to have somebody off up in my motherfucking house""
She hopped up and said, ""That's enough.""
She said, ""I can't take no more.""
And then she said, ""You made your point
But now it's time to even the score.""
She said, ""I know all about last night
And where you went when you left the club.""
Said, ""That's right, nigga I was there
With this guy in the back of the club.""
I said, ""I thought you was with yo' girls?""
She said, ""I thought you was with yo' guys?""
She said, ""You was at that bitch's house
And don't even try to act surprised.""
I say ""babe..."", she said, ""Shut up
Don't you say a word
It ain't nothing you can say
That I ain't already heard.""
Then I said, ""Woman, don't you try to turn it all around
'Cause the fact still remains that someone else was in my house.""
Then she said, ""You're right about that
Something did go down, but I don't have to turn it around
'Cause what goes around comes back around.""
I'm moving a little closer to her
She's tripping over the furniture
She said, ""Wait first, just let me explain.""
I said, ""No need to just give me his name.""
And then she said, ""Uh... uh""
I say, ""Uh, what?""
She said, ""please sit down in a chair""
And I say, ""No, I'm standing up""
And then she cries out, ""I'm so scared to tell you
Because of what you might do""
And I screamed, ""Look girl, you better give me this man's name
And I'm not playing with you.""
She says ""Okay"", wipes her nose and then asks me about a girl named Tina
I thought to myself said it sounds familiar
Then I said, ""I probably know her if I seen her""
Then I said, ""Anyway, girl
What the hell does that got to do with this man?""
She said, ""He know my girl Roxanne""
I said, ""Who the hell is Roxanne?""
Then she says, ""Roxanne's a friend of mine
Who knew this guy named Chuck
Chuck's cool with this guy named Rufus""
And I'm sitting here like, ""what the fuck?!""
Then she says, ""Rufus wife, Cathy
We both went to high school

Reggae,R. Kelly,2005,TP.3: Reloaded,Trapped in the Closet Chapter 4,"Now I'm dashing home
Doing 85
Swerving lane to lane, with fire in my eyes
I got a million thoughts
Going through my mind
I'm thinking about what I'ma do
And who I'm gonna do it to when I get home
How could I have been so blind?
And then I look in my rear view
I cannot believe this
(Whoo whoo whoo)
Damn, here comes a policeman
He drove right up on me and flashed his lights
Then I pulled over without thinking twice
He hops out the car and walked over to me
And said, ""License and registration please.""
I looked up at him and said
""Officer, is there something wrong?""
He said, ""No, except you were doing 60 in a 40 mile zone""
Then I said, ""Officer
Let me explain please
You see the truth of the matter is
Is that I got an emergency.""
He said, ""No excuses and no exception.""
I said, ""This is some bullshit."", as he gave me the ticket
Said, ""Have a nice day."", and walked away
I said, ""Yeah right."", and drove away
Then I turned my radio on
And did 70 all the way home
I pulled up in the driveway
Hopped out and slammed the car door
Then go in through the back
Bust up in the house
Pull back the shower door
And she screaming, ""What's all that for?""
Then I'm like, ""Woman I called this house
And a man picked up my phone""
Then she said, ""Calm down
Did you forget my brother 'Twan came home""
""Oh...""
And that's all I could say was oh
With a stupid look on my face
Said, ""I forgot he came home today.""
And she said, ""That's okay
Because honey I understand
She said you don't have to explain.""
Then I took her by the hand
I kissed her and then we went to the room
Then I turned some music on
Apologized one more time
Then went down and start getting it on
And she started biting her lip
Grabbing me and making noise
Now we making love and she's in my ear whispering
""It's all yours.""
I said, ""I love you.""
And she said, ""I love you, too.""
Then a tear fell up out my eye
And then I called her my sunshine
And then she looked at me
And said, ""Baby go deeper please.""
And that's when I start goin' crazy
Like I was tryin' to give her a baby
The room feel like it's spinning
'Cause we keep turning and turning
As if we were in a whirlwind
The way our toes are curling
The next thing ya know, she starts going real wild
And starts screaming my name
Then I said, ""Baby, we must slow down
Before I bust a vessel in my brain.""
And she said, ""Please no don't stop.""
And I said, ""I caught a cramp.""
Then she said, ""Please keep on going.""
I said, ""My leg is about to crack.""
Then she cries out
""Oh my goodness, I'm about to climax.""
And I said, ""Cool, climax
Just let go of my leg!""

In total shock, me and her
I closed my mouth and swallowed spit
As I'm thinking to myself, ""This is some deep shit!""
And I said, ""So you're gonna tell me he's the one you been talking to?""
He says, ""Yes"", I says, ""No""
He says, ""Yes"", I says, ""No"", he says, ""It's the truth!""

Then I thought to myself, and said, ""Quick, you got three minutes""
And then it got real quiet, I said, ""Somebody start talking""
Then she said, ""My God, Rufus! I've got just one question:
How could you do something like this? I'm so hurt!""
He looked at her and said, ""Bitch please, you've got your nerve
With all your club hopping, lying saying you was shopping
And now here you are in our home, and you're calling me wrong?""
She said, ""Okay, you busted me!
And that much I agree, you've caught me cheating!
But this is a little extreme!""
He said, ""You are my wife sleeping behind my back
And now I come home and you got him in the closet, how extreme is that?!""

So, get to the point, or I swear I'm out!""
""Excuse me, please, but I think I can explain what's going on in here
My name is Chuck and I been knowing Rufus about a year
At midnight creeping around with him has been a living hell
Sneaking in and out of hotels
I said, ""Brother, spare the details!""
Then Rufus said, ""Chuck, please! Don't say nothing else!""
Then she screams, ""Rufus, you son of a bitch""
He says, ""Cathy, go to hell!""
I said, ""I thought you said your name was Mary
That what you said at the party
Man this is gettin' scary, I'm gonna shoot somebody""
Then Rufus starts yelling and screaming, saying, ""Cathy, this is all your fault!""
She throws a pillow at him and says, ""You were creeping too
The only difference is you didn't get caught!""
Chuck screamed out, ""WE'RE IN LOVE!""
Cathy says, ""Love my ass!""
Rufus said they're getting married, then I shoot one in the air!
Then I said, ""Not another one of you sons of bitches say a word!
'Cause all this shit I'm going through is unheard!""

Then I laughed out said, ""Thinking about the things that I've been through""
She wipes her nose and she sniggles and laughs out, ""I've been through it too""

And she start laughing more
Then next thing you know we both are
Cracking up on the floor
And she laughs out, ""I can't believe this idiot really answered my phone""

Just out of concern comes back to the house
Then he pulls up in the driveway
My car's parked crooked with the lights on
Then he goes around the back way
He hear the dogs barking like something's wrong
He gets to the backdoor and discover it's been broken in
He looks around, pulls his gun out, then proceeds in
Meanwhile we're laughing and laughing and laughing
But from his perspective he thinks somebody's crying
He gets closer to the bedroom and he would swear that somebody was coughing and sighing
Meanwhile we're in the bedroom laughing as I'm trying to continue to explain
She yells out, ""Sylvester, you're killing me""
I said, ""I swear that it went that way""
Then next thing you know, he bust up in the room said, ""Muthafucka freeze!""
And then I looked back up at him and said, ""Wait, you're that damn police!""
Then she screams, ""Baby, I mean James."" She says, ""Everything is cool""
And then he yells, ""Gwendolyn, I got this
I know you're sick and tired of this fool!""
Then I stood up, start walking toward him screaming, ""Man, get out my house!""
Then he yells, ""Freeze!"" She screams, ""Please!"" And I pulled my Beretta out
She cried out ""Sylvester, please don't!""
Visions of him making love to her
He said, ""Man, put the gun on the floor""
I can't stop thinking about him and her
I slowly put the gun down and then I put my hands up
He winked at me and smiled
And that is when I went nuts
Hopped all over him grabbed the gun
She screaming, ""Settle down!""
Going all around both handling the gun then all of a sudden, POW"

That she would find somebody else

Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone

'Cause when a woman's fed up

It's like running out of love

And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too too many times
Now I can't come around

'Cause when a woman's fed up

Mama taught me a long time ago
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it (Oh no, oh no)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

""You can cry a river
'Til an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you""

Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cookin' you ever had
Yes, it was and I miss her

I was at the club with who?
Get the fuck...man, you know what?

Girl I'm not about to sit up here and argue with you about who's to blame
Or call no names, real talk
See girl, only thing I'm trying to establish with you is not
Who's right or who's wrong, but what's right and what's wrong
Real talk
Just because your friend say she saw me at a club with some other bitches
Sitting in VIP smoking and drinking and kicking it, tell me girl
Did she say there were other guys there?
Did she say there were other guys there?
Were there other guys there?
Well, tell me this
How the fuck she knew I was with them other girls then
When the whole club packed?
Wait a minute, let me finish what I've got to say!
I've been with you five years and
You listening to your muh'fucking girlfriends
I don't know why you fuck with them all jealous no-man-having ass hoes anyway
Real talk
Always accusing me of some old bullshit
When I'm just trying to have a good time
Robert you did this, Kells I heard you did that
Don't you think I got enough bullshit on my mind
Real talk, hold hold up
Didn't I just give you money to go get your
Hair, toes and nails done the other day, hmm
Yeah your ass was smiling then
Real talk, oh
Gave who some damn money?
I ain't gave nobody no damn money girl
Is you tweakin'?
You see what your problem is
You're always running off at the mouth
Telling your girls your motherfucking business, when
They don't eat with us, they don't sleep with us, besides
What they eat don't make us shit
Real talk
You call my momma's house and what?
Girl my momma ain't gotta screen no calls for me
Real talk, and watch your mouth
Fuck me? Girl fuck you!
I don't give a fuck about what you're talking about
I'm sick of this bullshit, I'm coming home and getting my shit
And getting the fuck up out of Dodge
You ain't gotta worry about me no more
And the next time your ass get horny
Go fuck one of your funky ass friends
Hell yeah, you probably doing that shit anyway
You gon' burn what?
Bitch I wish you would burn my motherfucking clothes
With your trifling ass, Milton, you bogus girl, Milton
Start your car up and get ready to take me home
This bitch done lost her motherfucking mind"

Let's go

It’s 3am and I’m not with him
It’s the moment that I know we’ve both been waiting for
Now we can pretend we’re together again
In the dark letting this slow chill take control
And we ain’t supposed to be doin this
We know the consequence
But we’re past the limit and there ain’t no turnin’ back now
You already got my body gripped
Yeah boy you know I like that shit
So we’re past the limit
And there ain’t no turnin’ back now

Might as well go all the way
Hey there ain’t no such thing as a half mistake
So baby boy we might as well go all the way
Might as well go all the way
Might as well go all the way
You don’t know if your addicted till you relapse

From detox of lovin’ each other
If just for an hour or two or three
Till six in the morning
Do you have a good excuse
To be on the down low with me
In the tele suite
We know that we ain’t supposed to be doin this
We know the consequence
But we’re past the limit
And there ain’t no turnin back now
I already got the Magnum glove
You already got your ass poked up
So we’re past the limit
And there ain’t no turnin back now

You’re right back injectin’ me
Love is in our veins ain’t it

Hey, this is going out to all the ladies, you know what I'm saying
Because I had a little experience before I got my album out
Didn't nobody wanna give me no play, right?
Although, I did have a few girls in my clique that was down with me
(Tell us about it, man) But uh, this goes out to all the ladies who didn't wanna give me no play but now they sweatin' me, you know what I'm saying (Talk about it, brother)
But it's cool, I'm with that. But I just want to get somethin' off my chest with this second album, a'ight (Talk about it)
So I'ma break it down, explain it to ya like this:
Back in the days I used to say
'Can I get with you today?'
And you told me 'No Rob, no way, no how, not today'
I used to say 'Do you mind if we spend a little time?'
And you told me 'No Rob (No, Robert), no way, no how, not today'
I used to walk up to the girls, I said, 'Can I rock your world?'
And they told me 'No Rob (No, Robert), no way, no how, not today'
And I used to say, 'Can I knock your boots today?'
And you told me 'No Rob, no way, no how, not today'
But now that I'm all that, you see they used to call me wack
But now they say 'Yes Rob, come on, right now, you go, boy'
You see they used to call me stank
But now I'm walking to the bank, and now they tell me
'Yes Rob, come on, right now, you go, boy'
I asked them time and time again
But now they see me driving in my Benz
And now they say 'Yes Rob, come on, right now, you go, boy'

But if pinched up is how a nigga end up
You know I make sure I hit her with the prenup

Then he notices the pie on the counter: one slice is missing
Now the story's gettin' scary
'Cause he comes to realize that Bridget is allergic to cherry

And she rushed to to door, blood on her hands screamin', ""There goes your whole career.""

And then I said, ""Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't...""
She says, ""No, you killed my brother""
She said, ""He just got out of prison. He's been through a lot

Sylvester what is this policeman doin' here?""
And I said ""Go on, tell him cop""
He says, ""Son, we gotta get you to a hospital and take a look at that wound""
Twan says, ""No, I'm okay. It's just my shoulder. All I need is a bathroom""
Now five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened
Twan says, ""Shit, man, I would've been better off in prison""
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like, ""Oh no! Here we go again!""
Thinkin' out loud to myself sayin', ""When is this shit gonna end?!""
Then Gwendolyn looks at me and says ""Baby, you got that?"" And I say ""NO!""
She says, ""Why?"" And I said, ""Because I'm not openin' up another motherfuckin' door!""
And the cop says, ""Gwen, I'll get it."" Then looks at me and say, ""Man of the house, my ass!""
Then I say, ""I'll get it, but whoever it is, I'm about to put their ass on blast!""
And the the policeman grabbed me I snatched away and got my gun up off the floor
Then Twan says, ""Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point that shit toward the door!""
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says ""Officer, arrest me later.""

Reggae,R. Kelly,2001,TP-2.com,The Storm Is Over Now,"I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standing
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be crying
Dead in the middle of a smile

But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice saying

The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa

Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racing for years
And still no finish line, oh

But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice saying

The storm is over

And I can see the sunshine

Somehow my beginning stepped right in (right in)

Reggae,R. Kelly,2013,Black Panties,Shut Up,"This song goes out...
To all the people out there that be runnin' their mouth
And don't know what the hell they sayin'...
Shut up

Now that I've got my voice back, let me start off by saying that
I appreciate the fans around the world that had my back
And I just wanna thank God upstairs for keepin' his hands on me
And for keeping all the doctors' focus during my surgery
Now, there's a couple of things I've gotta get off my chest
Some serious issues that I must address
Well lets just get right to it
People said that I was done
Said there was no way this time he's gonna overcome
And even before the doctors were done and I could awake
A tsunami of rumors had come to wipe my career away
After twenty two years of a blessed career
They had me lyin' in my hospital bed cryin' mad tears (woo hoo hoo)
But just as I had many people hatin' me, I had so many people lovin' me
And lets not forget the hood around the world coverin' me
But to everybody that be callin' me, tellin' me what they be sayin' about me
Bringin' me all of this negative shit, y'all the ones I ain't fuckin' with
It's time for me to evaluate the people that I let up in my space
Can I get a witness for all of this, people all up in your business

Tell em, shut up
Tell em, shut up
Tell em, shut up
I'm talkin' to you

He's washed up, he's lost it, he ain't got it no more
Well I'm here to tell you today, boy you haters are so slow
And it saddens me to know some of y'all want me to go away
But when it's time for me to go, my God is gonna orchestrate
Until then, I will accept the stones and pray and just try and get along
But sometimes it's so hard for me to be strong
I got kids and I'm tryna love em
So many things I'm tryna juggle
But I never thought this music would become my struggle
The news said I lost my house
My own people put me down
And my friends no longer around no
But you see deep underneath the surface
Now it feels that something's working in my behalf, a victory is near
See my future ain't my past, it's not the end of the hourglass
Who said it would not last?
Fans, sick their ass


Now seriously after all these hits and melodies and memories
You compare me to someone else, O-M-G
No offense to the other artist, but come on dog, lets be honest
How many babies been made off me? O-M-G
Seriously, you're gon' act like that
Sit there like there ain't no truth to that
Lookin' at me like I'm not talkin' stats, O-M-G
Every boy, every girl, every child around the world
From the 90s up until today was made off me
Shut up, shut up, shut up
I'm talkin' to you
Shut up, bout my life
(?)
So just shut up, just shut up"

She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real

She took me back
After I broke her heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl, she raised me
And I'm forever indebted
And I'm forever indebted
I'm forever indebted to her 'cause...

When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real, oh

She filled my soul
With the very touch of her hand
She really did
And she’s got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand
And I'd like to tell her, I'd like to tell her
That I’m forever indebted
That I’m forever indebted
I’m forever indebted to her 'cause...

When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real, yeah, yeah

See, a woman's love, it will never die, no
Even when I’m dead and gone
I’m gonna love her from the sky
'Cause she’s given me
Something that no other woman has given me
Woo-hoo, when I think about the girl, it makes me sing

When, when, when, when, when a

Yet you're telling me that everything is cool
Trying to convince me, baby, to do as you say
Just go along and see things your way

And keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

Secret lovers is what you wanna be
While making love to him, girl, you're silently calling on me
What is a man to do in a situation like this?
I feel there is something that I, I don't wanna miss

And keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

Beautiful you are but you're his by far
Coming by my way driving his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together

And keep it on the down low

How could you go, so low, so low

Reggae,R. Kelly,2003,Chocolate Factory,Heaven I Need A Hug,"I'm just bein' real, you know
I'm like the sun, I'm tryin' to shine on everybody
You know what I'm sayin'
But it's like situation after situation, you know
So I write about it to get it off my chest, you heard

Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Ever since you left, your baby boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me, what am I supposed to do?
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high
I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like, if Jesus loved me, why He leave my side, mama?
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth
(For real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(For real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(For real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(For real tho') The more y'all don't wanna let me live
When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be yappin' off
Somebody out there please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me, and lift me up, oh yeah

I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin' ('Cause...)
'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the ghetto with his paper and pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo, we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memories
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors, be careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine
(For real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(For real tho') It hurts to know you wanna see me fail
(For real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(For real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held
They turned they backs on you, who was there believin'?
Who said your troubles were only for a season?
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it all out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
(Please shower down)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me, and lift me up (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Man, I tell you it's enough to make you wanna give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and two brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another?
Instead of hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what wanna I see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dine and me
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are higher
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fire
Frankly, y'all, to keep it real, I'm just tired
Dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is a liar
(For real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(For real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(For real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(For real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me
And as for Robert, here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
And media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard
Somebody please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm still young tryin' to figure it all out

And gets right on the phone
Backing up, shaking his head saying
""Let me get my crazy ass home""
And his wife picks up and says
""Darlin' where have you been
I've been worried about you""
And he says ""Police business, honey, I can't wait
To tell you what I've been going through""
She says ""Are you okay?"" ""Yes""
""Do you need anything?"" ""No""
""Well, I baked you a pie"" ""Mmm""
""Your favorite: cherry""
Then he said ""I'll be there soon
Sorry I kept you hanging""
Then she said, ""Honey, don't worry about it
Just take your time, I still got some cleanin'""
Now meanwhile Miss Rosie's back at Gwen's house
Tellin' it all
She said, ""I knew there was something about that policeman
I started to cut loose my dog""
Gwendolyn looks at her and laughs and says
""Miss Rosie you are nuts""
And I say, ""All I wanted to know
Was what was you gonna do with that spatula?""
And then we all laughed
'Twan says, ""She's a G no doubt""
Now let's head right back on over
To the policeman's house
He pulls up in the garage
She doesn't expect for him to come that soon
She rushed to the door
Kiss him on the cheek says, ""I was in the restroom""
Then he said ""Whatcha say that for?""
And then she says, ""I don't know""
Then he step back, look at her and says
""What you all jittery for?""
Then she says, ""Sweetheart, maybe it's that time of the month""
Then he says, ""Maybe? Maybe that time of the month?""
And then she said, ""You know what I mean""
He says, ""I know what came out yo mouth""
He said, ""You said maybe""
Then she says, ""Baby"", he walks in the house
And she tries to lead him upstairs
But he goes straight to the kitchen
She says, ""Hun, I bought you some pears""
And then he said, ""I'mma heat this chicken""
Then she turns around thinking to herself
With this weird look on her face
Then he screams, ""Woman, what's wrong with you
Why are you walking back and forth, pacing?""
Before she answers she's thinkin' to herself
""What am I to say?""
Because the truth of the matter is
That she just slept with another man today
And he started calling her name
""Bridget, I know you hear me""
But she can't turn around
Because the truth on her face
He will see it
Then he screams ""Bridget!""
""Yes"" ""Look at me""
Bridget turns around and then he says
""What you got up your sleeve?""
She's scared out of her mind
Stuttering and shaking and
Still talking about some pears
He starts screaming saying
""Look woman I done told you I'm not going up no stairs""
Now he's got a funny feeling
Something just don't seem right
He's looking at her while she's backing up
Then he says, ""With all my might
Woman, I swear I'll shoot somebody
If you been doin' wrong""
But little does he know that somebody is still right there in his home"

True blessings (what)
All because of love
I was riding in my car one day (oh)
In the express lane rolling down the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings
Then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor felt, on the back seat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before I knew it
Here comes this truck now
The doctor said I don't think he's gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said unto me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
And for 10 years I've been straight
Chorus:
You saved me(woah) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me
Now I've been sitting in the chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone would call me with a job opening
Cause its been so hard for me month to month
Struggling to eat but still there was no answer(no answer)
I stopped believing in his word And got so mad at him
When somebody say Gods good I just laugh at them(oh yeah)
And in the nick of time his blessing rained on me
By his grace the phone ring a lady says were hiring
And that's when I knew
Chorus:
You saved me(saved) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me
Now I was 18 out on the block selling drugs
With a gun at my waist And for people had no love
See the streets was my home and family and friends were gone
Had no one to trust and deep inside I was all alone
And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before I knew it I was on my knees
(Blood gushing out my body my hearts beatin fast
I don't know what I'm a do I don't think I'm gonna last)
Then I began to flash back on the thing I've done in my past
(Then I heard a small voice that said to me I'll give you peace if u believe)
I accepted Christ that day hallelujah now I'm free
Chorus:
You saved me(saved) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me
I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering where did it come from
(I got tested)and the results came back and the doctor said I'm sorry but you got cancer
I could not believe it so I called up my mama to calm my nerve
(mama)she got down on her knees (mama)she said a prayer for me
(mama) said just keep on thanking Jesus (mama)he'll give you all you need
That was five years ago don't have that pain no mo

Reggae,LANco,2016,Hallelujah Nights,Greatest Love Story,"They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me"
Reggae,LANco,2017,Hallelujah Nights,Born to Love You,"I was born in a town full of red pine trees
County sign says ""follow your dreams""
Westbound train makes the whole town shake
Friday night lights decide your fate

Born again in a church where the steeple's white
Preacher preach Book of John and my momma cried
Meaning of life was in verse 2
Didn't make sense 'til I found you

I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you

I was a wild child between lost and found
Then you spoke my name, it was a sweet sound
Rescue kiss and you pulled me in
All my life baby, where you been

'Cause I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you

'Cause I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you"
Reggae,LANco,2016,Hallelujah Nights,We Do,"Drinking on the weekend, dollar PBR
And I dont got my keys so I can't go far
But I really don't have another place to go
This is all I need and it's all I know
I got my friends all around, my hand on my girl
I really don't care about the rest of the world
We are doing things our way tonight
And if you don't approve, that's alright

This is our life, love it or hate it
People may not appreciate it
We do, we do
This is our town, love it or leave it
We got it made, if you don't see it
We do, we do

Someday we'll have real jobs and we'll probably have kids
We probably won't tell them all the things we did
But we'll make it in the future some way, some how
But we're living in the moment, in the here and now
We don't got alot of gas, we don't got alot of money
But we got alot of jokes and we always think we're funny
It's the simple things that keep us going
It's the simple things that keep us knowing

This is our life, love it or hate it
People may not appreciate it
We do, we do
This is our town, love it or leave it
We got it made, if you don't see it
We do, we do

We don't have alot but we make the most of everything we've got
So let's raise a toast
Here's to all the friends that we'll never forget
And here's to all the times that we'll never regret

'Cause this is our life, love it or hate it
People may not appreciate it
We do, we do
This is our town, love it or leave it
We got it made, if you don't see it

We got it made, if you don't see it now

Reggae,LANco,2018,Hallelujah Nights,Pick You Up,"I heard from a friend of a friend
That you been staying home a lot lately
Just thought you should know you're not alone
I've been driving myself crazy
Thinking about the good times
Back when you were all mine
We were flying so high
Nothing but a blue sky
And my passenger seat misses you with me

I still got that '04 V6 and I ain't seeing anyone
I'll pick up the broken pieces
I can pick you up
I can pick you up

Don't you think by now
We should've found some way to be over eachother
Maybe our goodbye wasn't right
You and I ain't come and go lovers
Ain't no reason now for you to still be down
I'm on your side of town
Can you hear the sound of my engine running
Hey girl, I'm coming

I still got that '04 V6 and I ain't seeing anyone
I'll pick up the broken pieces
I can pick you, I can pick you up
I dont remember where we lost it
But I miss when we were us
Let's pick up right where we left off
I can pick you, I can pick you up
Oh I can pick you up

You could stay down or I'll pick you up
Shut the world out or I'll pick you up
Coming over now, gonna pick you up

I still got that '04 V6 and I ain't seeing anyone
I'll pick up the broken pieces

Thinking about you baby and I don't know why
But I do, oooh, I do
Seeing fireworks dancing up in the air
And I think about the ocean and your salty hair
I do, oooh, I do
If I see you in a bar and I ask you to dance
Will you remember our little summer romance
'Cause I do, oooh, I do

'Cause it was one night, it was one chance
When the morning sun came up over the sand
So long, you were gone
You can get your number, don't know where I'm from
But if you're out there tonight, I hope you still dream wrong
I do, oooh, I do

And when you get a little buzz and lay under the stars
Do you still think about us small
We all, we all look up at the sky
No longer you and I
No matter how far apart we are
We are, we are, we are, we are

'Cause it was one night, it was one chance
When the morning sun came up over the sand
So long, you were gone
So long, so long, so long

It was one night, it was one chance
When the morning sun came up, came up
It was one night, it was one chance
When the morning sun came up over the sand
So long

And I probably won't ever see you again
But I'll always dream of taking your hand
And saying I do, oooh, I do"

Can't you feel the anticipation
Like the calm before the storm
Can't say now that we ain't been warned
It's been a while since I've seen your smile
Light up the night like the fireflies
Honey, we're too young to be sitting somewhere, doing nothing
Let's get out there while we're still young and wild

These are the hallelujah nights
These are the best days of our life
The ones we won't get back
The ones that go too fast
The ones that make you feel like heaven might be right next to ya
Throw your hands up, hallelujah
These hallelujah nights

I can hear tomorrow calling
But you and me and the stars are falling
The night is young and 'till it's done
Love feels better when it's on the run
While we're still young and wild

These are the best days of our life
The ones we won't get back
The ones that go too fast
The ones that make you feel like heaven might be right next to ya

Anything that I can do to try and get a shot at you
This could be my night to prove

I could be the one you call baby
You could be the one that I love like crazy
Every night 'til the end of forever
The kind of love that only gets better
We could be the one in a million
Butterflies, once in a lifetime feeling
If it's too fast, I can take it slower
But tonight I'm gonna win you over, over

Driving on a back road
Going about 45
Put your hand on my knee
Never felt so alive
This must be the feeling that they talk about in movies
Never thought I'd find the one who can do it to me

I could be the one you call baby
You could be the one that I love like crazy
Every night 'til the end of forever
The kind of love that only gets better
We could be the one in a million
Butterflies, once in a lifetime feeling
If it's too fast, I can take it slower
But tonight I'm gonna win you over, over
I'm gonna win you over, over
I'm gonna win you

I know it's getting late and you need to get home
But life's too short to go it alone
We all need something to get us through
I could be yours and mine could be you

I could be the one you call baby
You could be the one that I love like crazy
Every night 'til the end of forever
The kind of love that only gets better
We could be the one in a million
Butterflies, once in a lifetime feeling
If it's too fast, I can take it slower

You and me, singin' at the stars
Moving real slow, falling real hard
I wouldn't wanna be anyone
But who we are, who we are
We could stay all night or a whole lot longer
Kiss me like that and I'm a goner
It's a sweet song and I know it by heart
It's you and me, singin' at the stars

Slow dancing in the clovers
Over and over
Hands on my shoulders, couldn't be closer
And the radio ain't even on
You in the moonlight couldn't be more right
I lose all track of time but I don't mind
If we dance until the dawn

You and me, singin' at the stars
Moving real slow, falling real hard
I wouldn't wanna be anyone
But who we are, who we are
We could stay all night or a whole lot longer
Kiss me like that and I'm a goner

You need to be back by 11
But time don't stand still on this side of heaven (Hey)
You had a little red dress on (Oh mercy)
The only thing I could shout (Change the station)
To an Alabama song, loud (Hey)
And we gassed it up and we headed out (Hey)

You were dancing by the oak tree
When you looked right at me
And you pointed to the cold creek
And said ""Hey boy, come and follow me"" (Hey, Hey)

When your silhouette jumped in
Little chill bumps on our skin (Hey)
Well I was the hottest I had ever been (Hey, Hey)

You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus, Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Ha ha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know

See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac

Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

Check this out, you motherfuckers know what time it is

Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Moo', pass the MAC and let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga

With the ready power tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!

Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac

Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas gettin' killed with your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (ha ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up!

I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run, ha ha
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressin' up tryna be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob
When we always on our job?
We millionaires
Killin' ain't fair, but somebody gotta do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep, you wanna fuck with us?
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'?
You're fuckin' with me, nigga
You fuck around and have a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it, bring it!
But we ain't singin', we bringin' drama
Fuck you and yo' motherfuckin' mama!
We gon' kill all you motherfuckers!
Now when I came out I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth
With a motherfuckin' opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this: fuck Mobb Deep! Fuck Biggie!
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label, and as a motherfuckin' crew!
And if you wanna be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!

You think you mob? Nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob!
Ain't nothin' but killas
And the real niggas, all you motherfuckers feel us

You know how it is: when we drop records, they felt
You niggas can't feel it, we the realest
Fuck 'em, we Bad Boy killas!"
Reggae,2Pac,1993,Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...,Keep Ya Head Up,"Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep ya head up"
Reggae,2Pac,1998,Greatest Hits,Changes,"I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change… and that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"" — well hey, but that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
(You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

Some things'll never change"
Reggae,2Pac,1997,The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,Hail Mary,"Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body (All through your body)
The blow is like a 12-Gauge shotty (Uh) feel me!
(Come with me Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now Do you wanna ride or die)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La la-da-la la la la la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me and my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga!

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up

If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary!

Killuminati, The 7 Days"
Reggae,2Pac,1995,Me Against the World,Dear Mama,"You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)

The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me

Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

Reggae,2Pac,1996,All Eyez on Me,Ambitionz Az a Ridah,"I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!

Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
(That's all you niggas got?)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

Roll up in the club and shit, is that right?
All eyes on me

But you know what?

I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings
Uhh, bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me

So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me

Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die

You try to plant somethin in the conrete, y'knowhatImean?
If it GROW, and the and the rose petal got all kind of
Scratches and marks, you not gon' say, ""Damn, look at
All the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete""
You gon' be like, ""Damn! A rose grew from the concrete?!""
Same thing with me, y'knahmean? I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin, ""Damn, he did this, he did this,""
Just be like, ""DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?""
That's what they should say, y'knowhatImean?
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty
Y'knowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
I'm just tryin to make somethin..

When no one even cared
The rose it grew from concrete
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet
It came from concrete

Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but, by keepin its dreams
It, learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared
No one else even cared..
The rose that grew from concrete

Did you hear..
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned to walk without having feet
Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams
It learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else, even cared

Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet (to breathe the fresh air)
It came from concrete (to breathe the fresh air)
(to breathe the fresh air, to breathe the fresh air)

You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its
Tenacity. We would all love it's will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses - this is the concrete - and these are
My damaged petals. Don't ask me why, thank God nigga, ask me how!

Reggae,2Pac,1996,All Eyez on Me,Life Goes On,"How many brothers fell victim to the streets?

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on

Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G

Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, 'cause life goes on

Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

Life goes on, homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga
You gon' be like, ""Goddamn, them niggas came up!""
That's right, baby, life goes on
And we up out this bitch
Hey, Kato! Mental!
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin'
When we get up there, man, don't front
Life goes on
Hold me no more, hold me no more
Yes it do, yes it do, yes it do"
Reggae,2Pac,1996,All Eyez on Me,2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,"Up out of there
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Reggae,2Pac,1996,All Eyez on Me,I Ain’t Mad At Cha,"Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit'cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
And I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

Reggae,2Pac,1996,All Eyez on Me,Only God Can Judge Me,"Only God can judge me (that right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (really)
Only God can judge me now

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me


I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live

Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, ""You can fade him""
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down, that's when ""I'll Be Around""
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

Guess you figure you know me, ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs drink them buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-Tay

Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is out for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby

Me against the world

It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

Me against the world
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby

With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby

With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world

Me against the world
Nothin' to lose

It's just me against the world, baby

I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter

Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'

Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
(It's all about you)

Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit
I mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?
What make that even more fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video!
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah"
Reggae,2Pac,1995,Me Against the World,So Many Tears,"I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come

Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

Lord, lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered many years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears"
Reggae,2Pac,2005,Loyal to the Game,Ghetto Gospel,"Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me
(Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

Lord, can you hear me speak?
To pay the price of bein' hellbound"
Reggae,2Pac,1997,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),Do for Love,"Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha

I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I’m bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit and run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry bout it we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
Do for love, yeah baby yeah
Do for love"
Reggae,2Pac,1999,The Rose That Grew From Concrete (Book),The Rose That Grew from Concrete (Autobiographical),"Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack
in the concrete
Proving nature's laws wrong it learned 2 walk
without having feet
Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams
it learned 2 breathe fresh air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
when no one else even cared!"
Reggae,2Pac,1996,The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,Me and My Girlfriend,"Shit, you mothafuckin' right!
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, west side! What?! Bring it on!

Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind

Our childhood years recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor — father, forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcisin' all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page, prime time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop

What?! I'm bustin' on you punk-ass niggas
Run, nigga, run! I'm on yo' ass, nigga
Run, nigga! Duck and hide
When I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga! Yeah, Westside!
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!

My girlfriend blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothin' compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, ‘cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin' niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war, never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin' by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall: me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

I love finger-fuckin' you, all of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin' for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy you just wanna be down
Talkin' loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit, you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Me and my girlfriend

Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin

Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it yeah?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

How do you want it?
How does it feel?

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alizé
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

How do you want it?
How do you  feel?

How do you want it?
How do you  feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it

Reggae,2Pac,2002,Better Dayz,Thugz Mansion,"Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (in thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (in thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me

This little nigga named Nas think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took five like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed 'em out
Next time grown folks talking, nigga close your mouth!
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall
To let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy, let's be honest: you a punk or you will see me with gloves?
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me bein' a thug?
And you can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with MAC's, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers tryin' to advance

Knew he was workin' for the feds
Same crime, different trials, nigga, picture what he said
And did I mention?
Promised to payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin', the world is mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch
Play the game, nigga; all out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga: ""Why you lie?""
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga, this M.O.B
So believe me, we enemies, I go against all odds

I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote; against all odds

Puffy gettin' robbed like a bitch, to hide that fact
He did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ridin' for that
And that nigga that was down for me, restin' dead
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin' or dead
Lord, listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written
Ayo, Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard my melody (This nigga sounds like Rakim!)
Read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life
So what's a ""chazzer,"" Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right
You've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die — goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me? Nigga

Hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
Against all odds, hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke; against all odds

21-gun salute, one love to my true thug niggas
(Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
21-gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
Representin' to the fullest, bein' soldiers with military minds
That play the rules of the game, 21-gun salute
I salute you, my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you bitch-made niggas, I'm comin' for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is
You touch me, I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers didn't think I forgot
Hell nah, I ain't forgot, nigga
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war unless I got my money right
I got my money right now, now I want war"
Reggae,2Pac,1991,2Pacalypse Now,Brenda’s Got a Baby,"Brenda's got a baby

I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
""That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family""
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say you makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby"
Reggae,2Pac,1996,All Eyez on Me,Can’t C Me,"The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see the P!
You must be goin' blind

Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes, open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe? Nigga, you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money, but baby, I've gots to get mo'
You screamin', ""Go 2Pac!"" and I ain't stoppin' till I'm well-paid
Bail's paid now, nigga, look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by niggas can't see me!

The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't see me

Been gettin' word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Sayin' they can get with us, but picture me gettin' served
My own mama say I'm thugged out
My shit be poppin' out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what! It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart, ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
D-R-E, you got me heated; my words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alizé and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
The life of a boss player, fuck what you thought though
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets; niggas can't see me!

Niggas can't see me
They can't see me
Which way did he go, George?
Which way did he go?
Oh!! Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?

You niggas made a mistake
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and it's judgement day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money, then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm gettin' green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker 'cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart; niggas can't see me!

Yo, check this out: stay off his dick

Niggas can't see me
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here
You niggas can't see me
You can't see me
I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face
But you still can't see me
You can't see me
All up in your range, but niggas can't see me
20/20 vision won't visualize
I'm in the flesh, baby, but you can't see me
All those glasses won't help you realize
You blinded, you blinded, you can't see me
You can't see me
Thug Life, baby
Don't believe everything you read!
Alizé and weed
You can't see me, right before your very eyes
You won't even visualize, you can't see me
Dr. Dre all day, 2Pac
Niggas can't see me
I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers!
This one's for you, BIG baby
'Cause you bitch-ass niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me
You can't see me
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
You won't see me
Yeah, first you see me, now you don't
Wanna see me, but you won't
Come to see me, but you can't
Oh, you can't see me

What's happening
Not motherfucking double R, Richie baby
What's happening baby, you know how we do it
Yeah nigga, you know I'm up out this bitch
It's time for me to uhhh regulate
Fo' sho', hey
Observe
And you ain't going back?
Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whassup though
This is for the honeys, the superstar
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me?
Well let 'em know

You fucking with niggas that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me 'til you sure
I ain't begging just trying to relocate between your legs
Dripping wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight begging to sex me got you undressing to test me and uhh..

Shut me down if you want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared, go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharing skirts

I'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is banging, got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of trying to make my songs pay
Making love all day against the wall in the hallway
Your fantasies come alive, your heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
('Cause) These busters ain't loving you right

Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see you blushing like you want something, come get a taste
Of Amerikaz Most Wanted and let's get into some touching, erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of busting until you learn your lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass

You can ride out with sport coat, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga and sport coat can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep you on the sidelines

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right

Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got you naked
Totally sweating, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissing 'til yo' head swang
I'm so into you, witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know
Now scream my name out; do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss player, freaky motherfucker, can I dig?

It's on and popping, now you see what I was seeing
Why your eyes rolling? Loosen up, girl, I ain't going
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold the boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm going home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You're in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
So I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life

Reggae,2Pac,2001,Until the End of Time,Until the End of Time,"Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time"

Why niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas!

Picture me rollin' in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance
That's what somebody be tellin'
Know there's dope bein' sold, but I ain't the one sellin'
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin' at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossin' a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin'
And my hands are swollen
Thinkin' of the G's I'll be holdin'; picture me rollin'

Can you see it?

Yeah, nigga!
Aye, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

I got keys comin' from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swangin'
Make me wanna start back bangin'
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin' 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
While I'm sippin' on Rémy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sittin' on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin' is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin' a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine, picture me rollin'

Picture me rollin'
Picture, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me

I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight sufferin' from lack of havin' paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin'-ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots (so what?)
Checkin' in the park, 'Pac

We caught him sleepin'
He didn't peep you niggas creepin'?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, you got the bomb spot
Nigga, time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you can get the females
This crooked shit that we inflictin', gettin' street sales

Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm cool as a motherfucker, I'ma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swoll

Just lookin' back at the world
From another level, you know what I mean? Starin'

Multiple gunshots clear the block, the fun stops
Snitches is callin' cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped carin'
Last night two kids shot while the whole block starin'
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me, then they lie to me
Product of a dyin' breed; all my homies tryin' weed
Now the little babies crazed, raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through intermissions, search your heart for a plan
And we turnin' bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview

What happened to 'em?
Well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
While you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin' until our dreams come through
Starin' at the world through my rearview

Now, I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin' days in this livin' black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section, from years of chin-checkin'
Turn to Smith & Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm gettin' hotter 'cause the world's gettin' colder
Baby, let me hold ya: talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!

Now I know the answers to the question
“Do dreams come true?”
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
I said, now I know the answer
“Do dreams come true?”
Starin' at the world through my rearview

Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you

Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for Glocks
'Cause fiends hittin' up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets
Somethin' I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed, bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants
Shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin' all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin' through your rearview

Hahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview
So, since you ain't knowin' what we mean, let me break it better understandin' the world…The world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understandin' on the game, and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
So, now we lookin' at the world from, high watch, behind us
Niggas know what we gotta do: just gotta put our mind to it and do it, it's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggas do what they wanna do, bitch niggas do what they can"
Reggae,2Pac,1996,The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,Bomb First (My Second Reply),"In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias ""Makaveli."" Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:

It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches
Power and money, ridaz and punks
Which side are you on?
*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*
*Encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?
You niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches
A'ight, it's the Raid on cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo shit, bring it!

Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes ‘cause they breed freely
See me rise, located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty, in every city
You'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, nah mean?
I hit the scene, niggas duckin' from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word a fuckin' nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs, down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in ’em
Cut ’em down, to Hell is where we send ’em
My whole team trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them ""my bitch-nigga eaters""
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, JAY-Z die too
Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay!
West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free – bomb first

We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first

For so many days, in so many ways we've been duckin' strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nuttin' to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission, sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch, yo I'm dyin' with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a ma'fuckin' Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made ""Paparazzi""
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfuckin' cash, mane
Then what is your motherfuckin' purpose? Narcing service
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, bitch!

Biatch! Come on, bring it, down with it!
Then we ride
Come on, bring it
Bomb first when we ride
Hey, get that nigga!

Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin' patent leather
Causin' massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin, you're tellin' fairy tales, dunn
""King of New York"" like you the motherfuckin' one?
But I'm from Jers', we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks all my niggas flippin’ chips
Gettin’ rich, even though it's hard
Tryna creep through these halls and brawls without scarred by a revolve'
With no warning signs, ‘cause yo, my man took five
Now I'm the youngin with the 9 ready to put in my time

Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first

Let us pray, my nigga
'Cause we definitely have sinned"

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

Look here, Miss Thang, hate to salt your game
But you's a money-hungry woman and you need to change
In the locker room, all the homies do is laugh
High fives ‘cause another nigga played your ass
It was said you were sleezy, even easy
Sleepin' around for what you need, see
It's your thing, and you can shake it how you wanna
Give it up free or make your money on the corner
But don't be bad, play the game, get mad and change
Then you wonder why these motherfuckers call you names
Still lookin' for a way out, and that's okay
I can see you wanna stray, there's a way out
Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school
And as the years pass by, you can show them fools
But you ain't tryin' to hear me ‘cause you're stuck
You're headin' for the bathroom, 'bout to get tossed up
Still lookin' for a rich man, you dug a ditch
Got your legs up tryin' to get rich
I love you like a sister, but you need to switch
And that's why they called you bitch—I betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

You leave your kids with your mama
‘Cause your headin' for the club
In a skin-tight miniskirt, lookin' for some love
Got them legs wide open while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga 'bout his car
I guess he said he had a Lexus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex?
I pass by, can't hold back tears inside
‘Cause Lord knows, for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonder why they stare and call you slut
It's like your mind don't understand
You don't have to kill your dreams plottin' schemes on a man
Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'
I'm hearin' rumors, so you need to switch
And niggas wouldn't call you bitch—I betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

I guess times gettin' hard, even harder for you
‘Cause hey now, got a baby on the way now
More money from the county, and thanks to the welfare
You're about to get your hair done
Got a dinner date, can't be late
Trick or treat, sweet thang got another trick to meet
The way he did it it was smooth
Plottin' while he gamin' you so, baby, peep the rules
I should've seen it in the first case, the worst case
I should've never called you back in the first place
I remember back in high school, baby, you was fast
Straight sex when you moved your ass
But now things change, ‘cause you don't look the same
Let the ghetto get the best of you, baby, that's a shame
Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
And finally be at peace
So where your niggas at now? ‘Cause everybody left
They stepped, and left you on your own
See, I loved you like a sister, but you died too quick
And that's why we called you bitch—I betcha!

You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch

Dear Ms. Delores Tucker, keep stressin' me
Fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind
I figured you wanted to know
You know, why we call them hoes bitches
And maybe this might help you understand
It ain't personal, strictly business, baby, strictly business
So If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch"
Reggae,2Pac,2001,Until the End of Time,Letter 2 My Unborn,"To my unborn child…
To my unborn child
In case I don’t make it
Just remember, Daddy loves you

Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Tryna earn every penny that I'm gettin'
I'm reminiscin' to the beginnin' of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My mama was a Panther, loud single parent, but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house
‘Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin' revenge for the agony they did to me
See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure gettin' better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child

I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty for bein' anxious
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin'
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate?
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
Dear Mama, I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child

I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

Dear Lord, can you hear me?
Tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love?
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?
‘Cause bein' black hurts, and even worse if you speak first
Livin' my life as an Outlaw – what could be worse?
‘Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who'm I kiddin'? I'm a thug 'til I die; I'm a rider, mane
Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein' there
Just know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord: I'm eternal, restin' in peace
Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child

Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child
To my unborn child…
This letter goes out to my seeds
That I might not get to see ‘cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothin' but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had
‘Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age, you’ll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I’ll see you if there’s a ghetto in Heaven
If there’s a Ghetto Heaven, I’ll be there waitin' for you
Heh heh, take care, run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes there’s confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it all day every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Friends come a dime-a-dozen
Be an individual, work hard
Study, get your mind sharp, trust nobody"
Reggae,2Pac,1998,Greatest Hits,Unconditional Love,"(What y'all want?)
Unconditional love (no doubt)
Talkin' about the stuff that don't wear off, it don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days, these crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
A motherfucker still love you, still feel you
Still there for you, no matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart with unconditional love

Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doin' years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God?
So we must ask forgiveness
Ask Mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears fallin' free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama, don't cry, long as we try maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don’t need no welfare and share with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it, the fightin' and the hurtin'
In my room cryin' because I didn't wanna be a burden
Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, with unconditional love

In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

Just got the message, you've been callin' all week
Been out here hustlin' on these streets
Ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's all G
We could never be enemies
'Cause you've been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs?
No wonder why when times get hard
'Cause it ain't easy bein' who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make G's eternally
And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation, if I could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
We work somethin' out of nothin'
No pleasure in the sufferin'
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin'
The liquor and the weed, the cussin'
Sendin' love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)

In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

I'll probably never understand your ways
With everyday I swear I hear you tryin' to change your ways
While gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Somethin' inside, please let me die, these are strange times
How come I never made it?
Maybe it's the way I played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes, so many vivid pictures
And all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters, 'cause after all the lights and screams nothin' but my dreams matter
Hopin' for better days, maybe a peaceful night
Baby, don't cry, 'cause everything gon' be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry 'bout a thing, baby girl, I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that unconditional love
 (repeat to fade)
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love"
Reggae,2Pac,1996,The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,Blasphemy,"God has a plan, and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
Through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our savior
And that Christ is returning, someday soon
To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity
For my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God
By accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and savior
Unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy

2Pac, don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed
And I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me
Remember what my pops told me

My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle, screamin', ""fuck they feelings!""
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this:
""Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, 'cause they breed envy
Now, rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies
Keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies""
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me, I smiled
Picture jewels bein' handed to an innocent child
I never knew, in my lifetime, I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studyin' rules
Now, papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nothin' free, get back what you earned
No doubt, gettin' higher than a motherfucka, bless me, please
This Thug Life'll be the death of me
C'mon, yeah

And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my pops told me
Blasphemy!

Nuf for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud
(Remember what my pops told me)
Using the name of the lord in vain
(blas-blas-blasphemy, blasphemy)
(Remember what my pops told me)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain

We pro'ly in Hell, already, our dumb asses not knowin'
Everybody kissin' ass to go to Heaven ain't goin'
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin' devil niggas daily
Plus the media be crucifyin' brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son; nigga, momma a virgin
We got evicted, had to leave the 'burbs
Back in the ghetto, doin' wild shit
Lookin' at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up, deadly
Babylon beware, comin' for the Pharoah's kids
Retaliation, makin' legends off the shit we did
Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waitin' for signs
God comin', she's just takin' her time (haha!)
Livin' by the Nile, while the water flow
I’m contemplatin' plots, wonderin' where the thought’ll go
Brothas gettin' shot, comin' back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)

And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my poppa told me
Blasphemy!

Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holding a bird in a cloud
(Remember what my pops told me)
Using the name of the lord in vain
(Remember what my pops told me)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
(What!)

The preacher want me buried, why? 'Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead? That's eternal fire
Why you got these kids' minds thinkin' that they evil?
While the preacher bein' freaky, you say, ""honor God's people""
Should we cry when the Pope die? My request:
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama, tell me: am I wrong? Is God just another cop
Waitin' to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin' up cash to the leaders
Knowin' damn well they ain't gonna feed us
In my brain, how can you explain time in B.C.?
It's hard enough to live, now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man
Well, he should understand times in this crime land
My thug nation, do what you gotta do
But know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? And my people say

Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holding a bird in a cloud
(Remember what my pops told me)
Using the name of the lord in vain
(Can't I remember what my poppa told me, blasphemy)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain

Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
In Earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
As we give up our debts
As we forgive our debt-ors
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For God's is the kingdom and the power
And the glory forever and ever and ever"
Reggae,2Pac,1995,Me Against the World,If I Die 2Nite,"A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once

They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffing weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin'
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, ‘cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes; the game should be sold
I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me
Addicted to drama, so even Mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
I'm duckin' the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin' my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block; what if I die tonight?

If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Fuck it, If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

Polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin' then they done
Calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method
Whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales
Picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversating like they still here; if I die tonight

If I die tonight
Scare to die nigga, is ya, ha?
If I die tonight
Never fear, never worry
If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

Pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the Heaven's, .357's to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin' when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin' these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, I live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading 'Murdered to death', my last breath
Take a look, picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand; if I die tonight

Nigga, if I die tonight
No fear nigga, never worry
If I die tonight
Bury me a motherfucking G, closed casket fuck it
If I die tonight
You know
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder"

Reggae,2Pac,2002,Better Dayz,Better Dayz,"Lookin' for these better days

Better days, hey
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids
Wanna try now, then lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches 'em, clockin' the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
‘Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals, and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried, plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days

Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

Thinkin' back as an adolescent, who woulda guessed
That in my future years I'd be stressin'?
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryna keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin' yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, ‘cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her, but she broke too
And so am I — I can't take her to the places she wanna go to
So, we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin', lookin' for them better days (for better days)

Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

Now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail
And me, I'm doin' cool
I settled down, had a family, workin' a night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days

Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

I send this one out to all the homeboys down in, uh
Clinton lockdown, Rikers Island
All them dudes I was, uh, locked up with, hehe
E Block, F Block, lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate
All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin', homeboy, keep your head up!"

And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck yo' brain
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all-time? When I created rhyme
For the simple fact, when I attack I crush your pride
Our intention to ride, every time, all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride
Breakin' in gas with the '68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies

So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable, like gas stations
Sorry, I left that ass waitin', no more procrastination
Give up to fate and get that ass shakin'
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to ""Rhythm Nation"", but thugged out, forgive me, Janet
Who's in control? I'm activatin' your souls
You know the way the games gettin' told
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alizé and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat

I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night

Well, I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylacs
For protection, so my fuckin' sack won't collapse
'Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays
Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MCs
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe: to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
You already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To L.A., on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Fuck you losers!
While you fake jacks, I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler stickin' up (Jews) with German (Lugers)
The mister Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket—blaow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan
Half of my clan's repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickels
Man, I stay on point like icicles
Now, who wanna test Tical, the tes-ticals
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Ayo, lyrical gat spittin' the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor, who? Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men, I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift
Now, you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MCs like ki's
My degrees freeze consecutively, like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake
Bust it, I'm the one pushin' the hearse, in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke off this antidote, got you ope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt
(And I'm out for nine-nickel)

Reggae,2Pac,1998,Greatest Hits,Troublesome ’96,"Troublesome, nigga
Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfuckin'-96
(Westside!) Let it be known, nigga!
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
These scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Outlawz motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends; fuck friends and foes!
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her ""my bitch nigga eater""
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
‘Cause they fear me in the physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die

Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troubleshit

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on 'em first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screamin', ""Fuck all y'all niggas!"" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass, like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin', ""please""
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died
‘Cause I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die

Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopeless
I live the Thug Life, losin' my focus, ba-baby
I'm troublesome, ha ha
Bad Boy killa, there is no one realer
What you saw
Was the rough, rugged and raw: Outlaw!

""Murder, murder, my mind state,"" shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme; the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen ‘cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry?
Tried to warn the little nigga, ""Either stop or die.""
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me ‘cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, ‘cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die

In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
Hahahaha – I'm troublesome, I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome… like my nigga Napoleon said, nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
Ha ha, I'm troublesome
You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique
Young, rugged and sick
Makaveli the Don, the Boss of all bosses
Mussolini, E.D.I. Mean, Hussein Fatal
Kadafi, Kastro, Napoleon, Bo-Nitty
Haha, we ain't fuckin' around
Haha, we troublesome
Ayo, ha ha, we troublesome, I ain't goin', HA HAH
Young Kastro, the first to blast, the last one to dash
Goin' for the hoes and the cash
Fuck you niggas! Outlawz! Ha hah!
Kadafi – trump tight, never sloppy
Them motherfuckers try to copy
But they can't mock you, nigga, you're too strong
Outlawz keep it goin' on, you know whassup
Outlawz, Outlawz, all you niggas die
Outlawz, Outlawz
This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets

Reggae,2Pac,1995,Me Against the World,Temptations,"Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy

Yo, Mo Bee, mayn, drop that shit!
You know what time
Boo-yaow! I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand, you know what I'm sayin'?
And uh, throw up that finger!
Hey yo, throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style, baby, thug style, y'know?

Tell me, baby, are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if you're only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong, love, tell me, 'cause I get caught up
In the life I live, it's hell, see, I never thought
I'd see the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard?
I've been known to clown and get around, that's my word
See you walkin' and you lookin' good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
With your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony
Cause I hate it when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin' in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go—

Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go
Throw them the finger!
You know what, baby, it's like—

I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

Will I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin', I'm passin' by
Everybody knows I'm ballin', and to God
Gotta keep myself from fallin', but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was—

Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up!
That's just the thug in me, girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like—

I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

A lot of people think it's easy to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was—

Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go
Yo, this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey, y'know?
Throw your fingers up!
You know? They gonna peep this
This how we run game on you
All my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger!
Throw your hands up, give 'em the finger!"
Reggae,2Pac,1997,Gridlock’d (The Soundtrack),Never Had A Friend Like Me,"Never!
You ain't never had a friend like me!
Believe that!
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me!

See, at night I watch the sky
I take another breath
I smoke my Newport to the butt
Like it's the last motherfucker left
Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy
Ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fail
Collect calls to my dogs from the county jail
Sending me mail
Heard the block's in the same shape
Ain't nothing changed
Niggas slanging at the same place
The same faces
Suppose to always hate our foes
This lifestyle lives forever
Watch the game unfold
Shedding crocodile tears, just got life plus
And you wonder if these white judges like us
Just stay strong, we'll appeal, nigga, you'll be free
Down with ya to the very end
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

How can I be blamed? Forgive me, Lord, I'm insane
In search of fame, won't hurt to change
Following the foot steps of past dealers
Equipped with Ski masks, no witnesses as we blast squealers
And now they feel us in this act of war
More casualties, no survivors
Any man that defies, quickly dies 'cause we riders
In my quest for chips
We wear vests, equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin'
'Cause niggas died over information
How much more can we take
Expect us all to wait
The world ain't ready for us yet so let's make Clinton pay
They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we possess
We had to fight and take it
I think the president is smokin' weed, bumpin' this beat
Makin' a livin' out of my misery
'Til he got a friend like me

I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me

'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

Promise to visit
I know it's rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail
This is hell
When I was younger
I could picture livin'
In luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison
Fuckin' snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama, he alone die, nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga 25
So now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties, why the fuck should I let you live
When I'm dead inside?
Rapid fire my delivery
I'm bustin' at they whole crew
Nigga, remember me
Hit up my Outlawz set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask
And get to straight coastin'
It's visitin' day at San Quinton
Always there to see your closest roaddog

I'm down for you so ride with me

Reggae,2Pac,1996,All Eyez on Me,Heartz of Men,"Hey, Suge, what I tell you, nigga?
When I come out of jail, what I was gonna do?
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right?
Heh, watch this!
Hey, Quik, let me see them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars!
Hahahahaha! Yeah, nigga, time to ride!
Grab your bulletproof vest, nigga
'Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now, me and Quik finna show you niggas
What it's like on this side—the real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now, the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now, everybody keep your eyes on the prize
'Cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends, but, in real life, they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life, they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life, those niggas will be snitches
It's a dirty game, y'all
Y'all gotta be careful about who you fuck with
And who you don't fuck with, 'cause the shit get wild, y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1, it's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, every one of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary, niggas scaried and paralyzed
Nothin' more I despise than a liar, cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker, why these devils left me free?
I proceed to make 'em shiver when I deliver
Criminal lyrics from a worldwide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere, Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waitin' for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors, but I'm infinite, Immortal Outlaw
Switchin' up on you ordinary bitches like a southpaw: you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a G
I rip the crowd, then I start again, eternally, I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The hearts of men

The hearts of men

My lyrical verge with so much pain, to some niggas, it hurts
My guns bust, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw, and five-o
Get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G to this until the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down, thought I'd rot in jail
Paid bail, well, a nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if you let me
A motherfucker if you do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number, then start again
Don't have no motherfuckin' friends
Nigga, look inside the hearts of men

In the hearts of men

To all my niggas engaged in makin' money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer livin' in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced that this is my year like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is havin' problems, open fire and bomb
I died and came back, I hustle with these lyrics
As if it's a game of crack, thuggin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowin'
Scarred up but still flowin', energized and still goin'
Uhh, can it be fate, that makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous-ass cowards 'cause they evil and fake?
What will it take? Give me that bass line, I'm feelin' bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent, 'cause I've been sent, the hearts of men"

God bless the dead and buried, nigga, don't worry
If you see God first, tell him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you representin' the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers caught up in the whirlwind
The other day I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin' shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin', never meant to do time
My epitaph will read ""was the last of G's""
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead

God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead

Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin' to hang
I can see 'em in my head – pow!
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin' back in my yearbook
All the years took half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die, will they all shed tears?
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoia got me lookin' in the mirror
Behind me, life without my 9, I'd rather do the time
See, I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
 and all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail?
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin'
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin'
I keep a gun and never run unless I'm comin' at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead

God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead

Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early
All the young motherfuckers that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin' G's, this one is for you
Yo Stretch, Biggy
Yo Big, this is to you, my nigga
Springfield Hollis Crew, Thug Life, YG'z
Sendin' they respect, ya know what I mean?
You my nigga for life, forever
You're always gonna be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget that!

I pray before I go to sleep, ""Dear God!""
Say my grace before I start to eat, 'cause times is hard
So I'm droppin' to my knees, ""Oh why!""
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock-a-bye?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, Uzi weighin' a ton
Niggas terrified of drama from the young gun
Hearin' that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind-blowin' so I'm flowin' goin' crazy
Slipped, forgot the gun, but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
But spunk is what he had, kid, I'd rather attack Big
Now you 'bout to smell the aftermath of what the mag did
Wannabe suckas wanna test, I'm tellin' you, yes
The teflon's 'bout to rip through your fuckin' vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
The spirit Biggy Smallz and the thuggin' clique, yeah

Now fire when ready, stay watchin' our figure
Increase speed, make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggas that you run with be on some dumb shit
Trickin' on hoes, I ain't the one, bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick
Have every single bitch that came witchu on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin' you stupid bitches, this is telekinesis
Am I reachin' your brain? Nigga, how can I explain?
How vicious this thug motherfucker came
When I die, I want to be a living legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin' game, with no more pain

Pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggas to open fire
I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the cops come runnin'

It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggas on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggas don't die
Can ya hear me? Laced with this game, I know you feel me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a soldier with a brain to teach your whole nation and feelin' no more pain

Reggae,2Pac,1995,Me Against the World,Can U Get Away,"Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?
Let me come swoop you up
(You know I got a man)
I know you got a man, but he ain't gon' mind if I take you out
(Of course he gon' mind)
Let me take you to lunch, I'll have you back before he even get home, before anybody see
(I can't, he ain't gon' let me
Aww c'mon! Pleeeeeease...
(Nah)
Oh aight – what's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?

Ever since I met ya I could peep the pressure
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations – would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love makin'
Got you shakin' when I'm standin' near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's gettin' clearer
All he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone
And find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate – but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me, can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon… Let's go… Can you get away?
Can you get away?

So much pressure in the air (I know, I know)
And I can't get away (Just for a little while love)
I'm not happy here (I know it's hard but, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air
(Let's go man, get up outta there, can you get away?)
And I can't get away (Do you love him?)
I'm not happy here (Do you love that man?)

Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
Ain't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me
‘Cause they phony
But you was different, I got no need to be suspicious
‘Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'
Now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow
Come see tomorrow
Hopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care – that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste
We can hook up at the store. Can you get away?

So much pressure in the air (I know it is)
And I can't get away (Yeah, you can)
I'm not happy here (You ain't happy, huh? Can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (I know… is he beatin' on you?)
And I can't get away (Did he punch you?)
I'm not happy here (Throwin' you around the house?)

I sit here reminiscin' and I hope you listenin'
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
‘Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home – that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker
‘Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows, on who controls will it last?
Before I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere
And even if you stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up, ‘cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
‘Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me, can you get away?

So much pressure in the air (Can't get away why?)
And I can't get away
I'm not happy here
(Let me take you away, all I wanna know, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (Man)
And I can't get away (Course you can get away)
I'm not happy here
(If you really wanted to get away, you could get away)

You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, ya know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't tryin' to put you in a position
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
You need, but now… he ain't even takin' care of you
He beatin' on you and shit; look how you look!
You too motherfuckin' raw to be with that nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
Ya know what I'm sayin'? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin' to Hawaii, seein' the world
Seein' what this world got to offer you
Not goin' to, ya know what I'm sayin'?
The emergency room, gettin' stitches
‘Cause this nigga done got jealous. Don't cry, it's all good

Can you take me from here?
Shake that man, get away
Can you take me from here?
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeahhh"
Reggae,2Pac,1996,The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,White Man’z World,"""You go bustin' your fist against a stone wall. You're not usin' your brain. That's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you! What makes you ashamed of bein' black?""

Nothin' but love for you, my sister
Might even know how hard it is, no doubt
Bein' a woman, a black woman at that, no doubt
Shit, in this white man's world
Sometimes we overlook the fact
That we be ridin' hard on our sisters
We don't be knowin' the pain we be causin'
In this white man's world
In this white man's world
I ain't sayin I'm innocent in all this
I'm just sayin', in this white man's world
This song is for y'all
For all those times that I messed up, or we messed up

Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison, I miss ya
Cryin', lookin' at my niece's and my nephew picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya
Kinda suspicious, swearin' one day you might leave me
For somebody that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow
Readin' love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't receive they mail, best believe we riot
Eatin' Jack-Mack, starin' at the walls of silence
Inside this cage where they capture all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Apologies to my true sisters, far from bitches
Help me raise my Black nation, reparations are due
It's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man's world—and all I heard was

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone's blind?
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
To let you know that you're not alone

Only thing they ever did wrong (yes!, yes!) was bein' born black (no doubt), in this white man’s world. All my ghetto motherfuckers, be proud to be black if you proud to have this shit like this, 'cause ain't nobody got it like this (all my little black seeds, born black in the white man's world). All these motherfuckers wanna be like us. They all wanna be like us, to be the have-nots: all hail. God bless the child that can hold his own, no motherfuckin' doubt.

Bein' born with less, I must confess, only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
I pass his casket, gently askin', is there a heaven for G's?
My homeboy's doin' life, his baby mama be stressin'
Sheddin' tears when her son finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama, why we live so poor?
Why you cryin'? Heard you late night through my bedroom door
Now, do you love me, mama? Why they keep on callin' me nigga?
Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin' in this jail cell, missin' my block
Hearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishin' they'd stop
Proud to be black, but why we act like we don't love ourselves?
Don't look around, busta, (you sucka!) check yourselves
Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still strugglin' in this white man's world

Who knows what tomorrow brings
(Born black in this white man's world)
In this world where everyone's blind?
(In this white man's world)
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
(In this white man's world)
To let you know that you're not alone

We must fight for brother Mumia
We must fight for brother Mutulu
And we must fight for brother Ruchell Magee
We must fight for brother Geronimo Pratt
We must fight for , Zulu, 
We must fight for the countless political prisoners
Who are locked up falsely by this white man

So, tell me why you changed to choose a new direction
In the blink of an eye?
My time away just made perfection
Did you think I'd die?
Not gon' cry, why should I care?
Like we holdin' onto lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me?
God bless me, please keep my seeds healthy
Makin' all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hopin' they bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells
Just in case they trip in Heaven—ain't no G's in Hell
Sister, sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and Kato
Too much for this cold world to take, ended up bein' fatal
Every woman in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see that we under attack?
I never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama
Hope we make it to better times, in this white man's world

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone's blind?
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
To let you know that you're not alone

""You're out of touch with reality! There are a few of you in a few smoke-filled rooms calling that the mainstream, while the masses of the people—white and black, red, yellow and brown, poor and vulnerable—are suffering in this nation.""

Never that, in this white man's world, they can't stop us
We've been here all this time
They ain't took us out, they can never take us out
No matter what they say, about us bein' extinct
About us bein' endangered species
We ain't never gon' leave this
We ain't never gon' walk off this planet
Unless y'all choose to
Use your brain, use your brain
It ain't them that's killin' us, it's us that's killin' us
It ain't them that's knockin' us off
It's us that's knockin' us off
I'm tellin' you better watch it, or be a victim
Be a victim, in this white man's world
Born black, in this white man's world, no doubt
And it's dedicated to my motherfuckin' teachers
Mutulu Shakur, Geronimo Pratt, Mumia Abu Jamal

The fear of understanding the Devil's running his horse
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor, minds full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate your conversates
Hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then cause there was no reacting, acting up

P's song is a natural tryptamine
My rhymes is so vivid, you start to see things
Way different, America's fake
I was fast asleep, but now I'm wide awake
I was under the spell of Kingu and reserved notes
Religion and fashion, I used to be flashy
'Til I had a total recall, forgot what I've already knew
It took me 33 years for me to see the truth
Ever so clear I was too young
I couldn't articulate myself the right way son
But now let me break it down, pass it all around
This is not a theory, lift the spirits, see his spirit
They wanna put me in a strait jacket in a padded room
And tell the world there's 12 monkeys so they can be confused

Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Secret Society trying to keep their eye on me
But I'ma stay incogni' in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically

But fuck that I'm tired of playing games with you kids
Ain't no time for playing, check the rhymes I'm sayin'
I write it for the streets for the hood inspiration
Inspire every party to map where it's poverty
I started with a Mobb but now I got an army
With soldiers and troopers
The TV and the radio scared to death of us
So we hit the YouTube up
Now I got millions of views
Now watch how many rappers follow what P do
Now I'm too hoody to conform to the program
I'm too much of a rebel for me to try to fit in
Nigga! It don't matter on the color of your skin
Right now you either positive or you negative
I got friends in high places, multiple races
And coaches on my side, all you got is paper

Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body

Peel on Ducatis and other four wheels
Write a book full of medicine and generate mills
Tour the album, only for more sales
We used to catch those on the block with crills
Now it's paid shows, promoters post up bills
Sign deals only if the math is real
If we can't match numbers, then you can't have the Head Nigga In Charge and shit
Live nigga rhymes artist
Pardon, P dub shines regardless
Remorseless, haunt niggas like poltergeist
My advice, 'fore you get like that, is think twice
Before you move on it, put jewels on it, who want it?
Loose niggas make the news when we start forming
Snatch stripes off a nigga's uniform often
Don't embarrass yo' delf you way out your jurisdiction

I don't fuck around dunny, it's most real

Yo, let me back up for 'em, lemme back up, yo, yo
While niggas bullshit on the grill
I don't fuck around dunny, it's most real
I gave birth to your whole style and feel
How do it feel, to hold my dick in public
Cock blower, duplicate rap cloner
It's me and you do it live on stage for dolo
I smack niggas like you, smash niggas by the tools
Grab niggas by the throat, show and prove
Rhymes cocky, crazy ill, mad rowdy
Did a buck off of my shit and wrapped your Audi
Temperamental, I snap quick, very touchy
Ayo my attitude is all fucked up and real shitty
I rap like no one out there can fuck wit me
You feel different, nigga, see me
I throw a TV at you crazy, bitches say 'P, you crazy'
A pain in the ass, nah but fuck you, pay me
I'm no shorty, nigga, I stop your glory
I'm a thorough street nigga for real, you just applaud me
Avoid P, man, take your baby mom's advice
I'm nothing sweet, ill with the guns, you pay the price
When you see me in the streets soldier, salute me
You just a groupie, oh, you gangsta, then shoot me
Who gives a fuck really, I miss my nigga Twin, kill me
So I can join the rest of my force up in the heavens

Is it ill, do it need to be fixed?
(That shit is real Dunn; and stop talkin like your skills don't kill)
Nah it's just that sometimes I feel like that
I can write more fouler than the last

Yo that shit is cash trust me Dunn; I'll never lead you astray
Take my word niggas wanna hear how you think
It be that shit that you wouldn't expect to win
That stay playin' in they decks over and again
Speak your thoughts, put your all in it
Whatever's in your mind, spit it
Place your anger on the page, release tension on the tape
A stress verse, seem to be what they most thirst
Makes fake niggas disperse, they never challenge what works

Balancin' the weakness, is what I specialize in
Dunn you my nigga, 'cause you keep me hype when I'm writin'
Kept me on point in the night when it might go down
Keep me eyes wide in the daytime as well
Kept me focused on what's real and nuthin' else
I find it healthy, to conversate with myself
I kick it with my delf (I kept you alive, all these years)
It's that inner voice you shoulda' took heed to and shit
Coulda' been home instead of bleedin'
Maybe next time you'll listen when it speaks

Yo Dunn, I got a story to tell
Remember last week's mission? I told you bring the gun
(Yeah I remember) Nah listen, without me you'd be a memory
I'm the one you could come to for guidance
Bring you home alive when you wildin'
Kept you out of harm's way, told you when to spray
Told you when it's time to put it away
And when the cops came, you was safe

Without question, I stay aware Dunn I'm listenin'
Everytime we speak it's real, I know your intentions
To make sure we both safe, livin' and breathin'
You gets all respect from me Dunn, believe it

Yo we got kids to raise and bills to pay
Enemies to lay down when they stand in our way, it's only us
(What about the clique?) Now if you die is they comin'?
When you shot do they feel the bullet?
And when you broke can they fix it? Aight then, you keep writin'
And let me do the thinkin', I brought us this far without mistaken

Voices in my head from choices that I dreaded choosin'
Cautions I shoulda took heed, lost in my weed, steady losin
Thug stripes, badges of honor, forces to succeed
Whores on they knees, fuckin' with millionaires, killers and thieves
I fuck until there's no feelin' where, I bust and I pee
I lusted cars but I suffered and my scars run deep
I stay to myself, one deep, pray to my God cause he
Say when it's hard get on one knee, and ask Thy for forgiveness
Fuck the cash, the ice, the Ferraris
With two-twenty on the dash when your life ain't right
See niggas smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back
Snakes shake your hand and got his dick up in your wife back
Why's it like that? It's life black and this is the game
The way I see it both bitches and niggas, is the same
I trust myself, I can't fuck myself
When hoes leave and no weed I still know me, just myself
Fear is weakness learn from what experience teaches
Beware of leeches, the vampires, my secrets
Never follow, 'cause most niggas is straight up cowards

You can't come out, wildin' out like that
Rhymes so vivid Dunn I see what you sayin""
But you gotta understand how I feel
The pain and the hardship it took to build
Years of frustration, some got killed
Others fell vic' to the gates of steel
Most try to instill sanity still
Stuck on this rock where we don't belong
I wanna go home not sing this song
But I'm forced to perform speech napalm
Calm, surrounded by all types of harm

Watch your hands nigga, I see that, word up..

Laid back in the cut like what?

Don't forget your soul's involved
That same energy you put out, comes right back it revolves
I smash you, Dunn only if I have to
I would hate to, but I'll be more than glad to
The positive and negative war has now begun
P helps you seperate both the sides
Let the truth arise, black devil don't hide
You can't hide from me, you might from the others
I've been employed to pull your ass out from the covers
You walk like you got hooves and talk like you 'sposed to
Trickin my brothers into followin you? Yo

Nineteen seventy four, motherfucker I was born with pain
My moms and my pops pass it down to me
So don't talk to me about can I feel yours
'Cause I ain't feeling you at all, your pain isn't pure
You crying 'cause you broke from the projects
That's not pain, that's emotions, you a bitch
I'm talking 'bout permanent, physical suffering
You know nothing about that
You just complain 'cause you stressed
Nigga, my pain's in the flesh
And through the years that pain became my friend; sedated
With morphine as a little kid
I built a tolerance for drugs, addicted to the medicine
Now hospital emergency treat me like a fiend
I rather die sometimes I wish a nigga OD
Begging God for help, only to find
That I'm all by my goddamn self
And you can never feel my pain, nigga

Naw, can never feel my pain, nigga
You can never feel my pain, nigga
Never feel the pain, nigga
You could never feel the pain, nigga
Naw, never feel the pain, nigga

And the females ask - P, why you always look mad?
Don't mind me if I may come off like that
But see, a nigga depressed, I need smoke
I need me a drink, I'm trying to stop those
Experience life, through the shoes of me
What you find, is you can't do that, you ain't built for it
The impact I put on this earth
It's like nutting that you ever seen or heard; so look listen
When I speak, sit up in your seat
Pay attention to the words, 'cause the story is deep
In and out of crisis, since before I could walk
It gave me strength though, nowadays I hardly talk
It made me cold-hearted, anti, I won't play sports
I barely joke or play games, take it how you want
My handicap took its toll on my sanity
My moms got me at the shrink at like 13
And doctors called the cops on me
'Cause I be throwing IV poles and they ignore me
I gotta, try to calm down and breathe
I can only hold it but for so long; put me to sleep
Do I sound insane? If I do, then this here was written for you
'Cause you could never feel the pain, nigga

Nah, you can never feel my pain, nigga
Could never feel my pain, nigga

You could never feel the pain, nigga

Come graduate from that old school
This is higher learning, we past that
Take a leap of faith and just let go
We waitin' for you in the aftermath
Behind The Wizard's curtain
This ain't Kansas for certain
We live in living color
Backstage at the Truman Show
Everything not three dimensions
There's so much more to be seen
Open up your third eye or you gon' miss everything
Then in the middle of all this
I got people with larceny in they heart for me
I must hold down the fortress
Stay alive and stay out the penitentiary
Better wisely choose your battles
Try not to think so small
It's a big psychedelic picture
Better turn your hatred to love, maybe not though

350s, nine millis, extendo 47s
They want us to all disarm, but we ain't givin' up our weapons (Fuck no)
It's the USA, mafuckin' USA, the US of A
We're black and beautiful, black is powerful
And we all here to stay
Right here in the United States
Mafuckin' USA, the US of A
Look, we are all beautiful, all powerful
All one human race
One love..."
Reggae,Prodigy of Mobb Deep,2011,The Bumpy Johnson Album,Black Devil,"Evil bastard
Cut throat warmonger
Backstabber, betray your own mother
You double tongued, double talk cause you two face-ed
You triple 6 with a hiss like satan
No good snake you only speak lies
Slime bucket scum of the universe
Your eyes reveal that you have no soul
And expose your true colors I see you
From three million miles away
That you's a sneaky motherfucker but you can't fool me
You not my bro, you not my sis
The devil doesn't have a skin color or a complexion
So you not my brother you not my sister
Your skin might be brown
But I know that you down with about two billion demons
Listen just stay the fuck away from me or get killed for treason
Against The Most High
You might got these other people scared of you
But that shit don't fly
Over here we laugh at you but it's not a joke
Because people need to know about the black devil


Yeah, the real outcast your time is up
It's not the end of the world, it's the age of aquarius
You's a deceiver
You got the whole world confused in a daze like some rats in a maze
You's a shape-shifter
I don't care if you the pope, the president, or prime minister
King queen, prince or princess
You just fronting for the public and you fronting for the press
But behind closed doors
What really goes on is
Ritualistic, cannibalistic, sadistic, masochistic
Some real sick shit
The most wicked there is that ever lived
Under the sun the infamous day walker
The movie Blade is just metaphorical
Yes, the greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Is convincing the world that the devil don't exist
People have no clue
They looking for a red man with a pitchfork but that's just not true
Some say that it's the white man
But yo I'm here to let you know if you ain't know about the black devil


Knowledge of equality of all people
Even though physically we not all equal
Erase the racism
The only thing I see when I look at a person is good or evil
But the 'black man is god'
Yeah that shit sound good
But that shit don't apply when you try and get a job
This is real world music, reality rap
We spent too many years on that fantasy crap
It's time we deal with the facts
And the fact is you ain't better than somebody because the color of your skin
I did three years in prison
And the white boys showed me more love than any of my so-called niggas
So you can go and ? your doctrine
The only thing that matters is you negative or positive
And you can go to hell even where I'm sure you'll be fine with the rest of your kind
People are so blind, so deaf, so dumb
Which proves you want to battle with the war not done
You might got these other people fooled
But you can't fool we because we know that you a black devil"

Do the 100 yard-dash and tear ass

Looked at 'em, gave 'em back to me
I could've swore they was takin' us in
Then the lady in the car said, ""that's not them.""
Picked us up, told me I could keep the drugs
They didn't give a fuck, they was only lookin' for guns
And you ain't gotta tell us twice
We hopped in the car and slid off
On our way uptown for more of that funk
P lit the tree back up
Got off the Triborough, hit the Henry Huds'

Shit, I'll be by my motherfuckin' self"

*P starts rapping at 1:03

Yeah
Don't try that with P, nah give ya'self a break
You're f'ing with the wrong nigga, do ya'self a favor
Back up offa me lil nigga real fast
Or just like that you'll be pushing up grass
You're a plant fool; I'll put your flesh in the dirt
I tried to be polite, but you wanna be a jerk
Tried to prove a point; the only thing that you proved
Is people get killed simply for being rude
You thought you was the man, turned out to be a chump
You thought something sweet, believe Jay if you want
Ga'head believe Nas or whoever you choose
You come on over here and you gon' see the truth
It's nothing out the ordinary, this is what we do
My team's so strong, I feel sorry for you
These rappers is pissed off, they're not being felt
They get record deals but their albums get shelved
While I'm...
(Chorus) Prodigy X2
Heavy on the dimers and heavy on the smoke
Pockets full of hundreds, doing hundreds in the post
GT Carrera nigga daring nigga front
Fucking with these young veterans you'll get done

We're heavy on the dimers and heavy on the smoke
Pockets full of hundreds, doing hundreds in the post
GT Carrera nigga daring nigga front
Fucking with these young veterans you'll get done
I'll react like a Terminator nigga what?
Won't stop coming till I know a nigga done
Rap is all good, it made me a millionaire
Or when it come time to squeeze yogi, we don't care
Now we thirty-thou feet in the air
Getting head from a pretty face who ain't scared
To fuck with these Gs and she's happy that she did
Cause we turned out to be that shit that she felt
Baby on the real, all these lame niggas know the deal
My dudes give out the wounds that never heal
On the real, all these lame niggas know the deal
My dudes give out the wounds that never heal
(Chorus) Prodigy X2

Don't be mad at me, be made at cha'self
For being so garbage you need to be kilt
For putting out bullshit like it's all a joke
Cause you're from the hood don't mean your shit is dope
Just cause you got bodies don't mean you're going gold
Like just because you black don't mean you got soul
Niggas coming home from doing wild time
Talkin bout P - ""Yo P I could rhyme""
50 Cent did it; I could do the shit too
But you not 50, he a individual
And you not H and you definitely not P
What make you think it's so easy to be?
I've been doing this since I was a Rugrat
I'm gifted; I'm blessed with talents you can't match
Stop dreaming, wake up and smell the Kush
You better than P? Nah you wish!!!

Reggae,Prodigy of Mobb Deep,2000,H.N.I.C,Veteran’s Memorial,"Memories play back like film
I flash back we was little niggas living most real
1989's when we first met
We first clicked over convo gettin twisted
In dun gram earth crib cutting outta school
Watching cable it seemed like the over day
Through the eyes of a stranger we was kids
But in our own minds we was grown mens
Outside on the block we would play the bench
And y'all play the rock every chance y'all got
As I sat back and just watched
Hey, what can I say?
The same back then as I am today
I can recall me, Jamil and Jamal
In the room drinking straight vodka with they moms
When I walk home with the big nefertiti charm
Back with the light blue camoflauge suit god
Me and Hav' doing it hard trying to get on
We sample songs on the box with record and pause
Killa B didn't even get his first firearm
And I was still holding one shot derringers

Who would think anyone of us would cease to exist
Left with just thoughts of the past to reminisce
Sometimes I see a chick walking past with ya kids
Or find an old flicka of some 1-2-fifth
All the shit that we been through it boils to this?
Dun, I wish we could start it all over again

95 we on top touring the states
A lotta times we even took the click overseas
Came along way from the hallway
Sitting in the staircase with bacardi
Bring the honeycomb speaker outside to bang
While we would share drinks with the other that came
Triple L stayed taking they cash in dice games
Killa Black grew to keep an ice grill, dun was not playin'
Yammy, the most infamous told me one day
'Put the bogies down 'fore I pound you out P'
But it was all love, we was each others duns
We held each other down, borrowed each other guns
Its hard to believe that niggas so strong
Could die so easily forever be gone
I could still feel the wet of your palm against mine
Cause we did our hand shake all the time
Why it have to be your time to go and not mines?
Spilled tears contemplating to my delf cryin'
All the laughs we shared and fights we had
All the nights we would get nice, damn
Plates of food we split in half
I dedicate the rest of my life to all my niggas that passed

Who would think anyone of us would cease to exist
Left with just thoughts of the past to reminisce
Sometimes I see a chick walking past with ya kids
Or find an old flicka of some 1-2-fifth
All the shit that we been through it boils to this?
Dun, I wish we could start it all over again

What's the fuckin' deal, motherfuckin' Scarface nigga, killer for Bean, Fugi, Gooey, I can't take no more nigga, Corey, Black Ed, the fuck, knahmsayin'? I'll Will burnin'

Straight up man, that's it

Abortion babies man, I can't take no more man
I'll never forget you, all my dead it's all love man
Motherfuckin' Yambo, in a minute, we'll be there
Motherfuckin' Yammy, straight up, I can't wait
You was my strength nigga, I miss y'all
I can't believe you gone nigga
(You was supposed to be right here)
What the fuck happened?
Ain't nobody else goin' away man
You ain't takin' nuttin' else from me man
Nobody can't take nuttin' else from me man, that's it
I dare you! Come try, it's over man
You can't take nuttin' else from us yo
That's my word, I put my life on it I'll be next nigga, straight up
I'll stand up for that
'Cause ain't none of my niggas goin', that's enough

No thank you, I pass
Please skip me for the next person

But no, really, I'm cool
I try to stay away from the things
That everybody else do
I've got my own thing happenin'
It's workin' out great for me
I'm healthy, I'm happy
I'm successful, and good money, uh
I hope that works out for you
Don't let my good heart fool you, I'll spaz out on you

How dumb y'all niggas look
How stupid y'all niggas sound
It's embarrassing, no good
How could you be so foolish?

Yeah that says a lot about you
For you to ever doubt me
You a bird, you comical

You're not sayin' nothin' new, nigga
I said that already
Niggas plagiarizin' my rap
As if they trend settin', please

I had to learn to keep my opinions under my hat
These rappers are trash, but ain't nothin' we can do about that
Just let their garbage ass live, God loves them too
Ain't that what they say? The Lord protect babies and fools
But when a fool try to play me
Wet him up, then I'm Swayze
Can't ever be this outstanding
Bitch, my song is amazing
Your shit sound like every other song that's playin' on the station
And your outfit looks silly
And your jewelry is all basic
Slumdog Millionaire watch
Yeah with all that fake shit
Only thing you can pull is a stripper or a waitress
With that credit card fraud bullshit
Try to talk down on me
Your favorite rapper a fraud
But I'ma just sip this tea
With a little E&J spike

Get it together or lose forever
Your things don't impress me

Exulted, affluent life style I kick
Calm shit that make your livest rep wanna harm shit
Don't be alarmed when the guns bang (why?)
It's only natural for my dunns to hurt something
Cop a squat though, you might learn something
We givin' out back braces and arm slings
Reality rap, the only song I sing
Nuttin fugazi, strictly the real thing
Live in the flesh, my niggas fresh out the pen
(When you see dem) When I see you dunn, new guns, money ain't a thing
(Money ain't a thing, nigga what, what?)
You could catch me and the clique, in the spot everyday
Nore guzzle the Crist', I down Chardonnay
Pardon me, 'fore you get knocked out the way
Everyday it's like a title fight take place (no doubt)
Aiyyo Nas - fuck that nigga just say? (What he say, huh?)

Gettin my dick sucked
Bone a bitch in the butt, make her say what-what

Now gun talk, do you speak the same language?
For your sake, I hope so, let's rap a taste yo
My shit spit like a retard, and plus boss
I drool for the day me and you could face-off

We blow torches, and celebrate good fortune
This is for my dunns who rest in coffins

While them cats small change like a E.S.3
Yo I'm still the same cat, that I used to be
Often, I'm on tour with my rosaries
Coastin', always hit 'em with the thug potion
Look at you now, now you just full emotion

Look straight in my eyes, tell me what you see?
Is it that same nigga that you fell for from the door
Ain't I that same nigga we was both on the train goin hard
And then your shit surfaced
Takin the phone in the bathroom, whisperin wit your girlfriends
Try to play me on some jerk shit
Numbers underneath the sole of your lady Timb's
... oohh shit!!

Kid, I kept it tight for you
Turned nigga's down, didn't go out all them nights for you
And I ain't even that type'a bitch
I heard about Jones Beach and Luke's Freak Fest
Nevertheless I still put my faith in you
You was my dog, so I stayed faithful
But I'll be god damned if I be some nigga dumb bitch
It's fucked up it gotta go down like this...

 Yo, have you ever had a bitch that'll pop guns for you?
 Type of nigga you'll do anything he ask to?
 Snake bitch turn around and backstab you?
 Crab nigga found out he fucked around too?
 Threw her cash, threw in the smash, that's boo
 Rockin your 4 wheel drive and tattoo
 Talk sweet thinkin that he rockin you to sleep?
 Who me? Fall for that bullshit, you got it twist

You was once my bunny, now you want to act funny
I'm that same nigga from the first day who dress bummy
Same grimy style nigga, I'm still hungry
I never lost my thirst for takin that money
I never lost my lust for chicks lovely
You met me on those terms, so that's how I'm runnin
I still walk up in the crib 5 in the mornin
... and still count my cash before I crash
What you thought, you had a dunny? I ain't the one honey
You skim 20's out of my stacks of Benny's
You done found yourself a street life love, to death do us
Remember that shit, now everything's ass-backwards
We was more like Mickie and Mallory
You fouled out on me; found another man math in your Bally bag, damn!
I wish you luck though, you sneaky bum ho
Catch you on the corner while I pass in my truck though

Yeah aight
First of all Fuck You, and everything you own nigga
You got a lotta nerve, nigga
I should throw a brick thrrough your shit, fuck your whips
It ain't about that, it's about you givin out my dick
Or so it seems, I can only call it how I see it
Got hoes callin the crib, hangin up not speakin
Come on, what type of shit is that?
What, I'm sposed to sit back, stay up all night for you to get back?
Like the world revolves around P
So while you strolled in at 5 I was comin in at 3, 3:30
Niggas wanna play dirty
Fuck it, that's how you wanna rock? let's get dirty
Yeah, condom wrappers in the back of the Azure
Talkin' bout you let your mans get off, your G ain't strong
I'm gone, you ain't worth the tears
You lost the best thing you ever had in your life, a waste of my years

That was Hav' brother, we called 'em Killa
Killa had an obsession for popping unexpected
He would just pop off when you wouldn't expect it
High shot 'em in his head, shit Killa ran home
Took some advil and pulled the bullet out on his own
A real nigga made of stone, we don't budge
We just stick to the script, when the Ds question us
Killa got knocked for a body and *Pump* snitched on 'em
The next thing you know Killa came home Muslim

Lord have mercy it seems you cursed me with a life of pain
All I do is strain, everyday a struggle, everyday it rain
Even when the sun's shining, they say that's when God crying
Dark clouds hanging over my head
May lightning strike me down if I'm lying
I miss my pops; all I got is lonely tear drops
And memories of him teaching me to hurt people with my bare hands
And how to shoot people
I remember me and him stuck a jewelry store
He did the sticking; I was in the get-a-way car
Pops came out with a big bag full of jewelry
We had a high speed chase with Nassau County
I was eight years old, my pops was drama
They locked him up and sent me home to mama

Thinking back it was me and -Moneybags up in Champion Motor
I was Ferrari dreaming, E copped the Navigator
On the way there and back, he told me about the jux
Him and Troy took the niggas for their shine and had 'em shook
And how he killed Black Just but he meant to hit Preme
Shot up the nigga Rover over by the Coliseum
I remember laying up fucked up in the hospital
Troy and Bags would visit; Troy had Sickle-cell
Me and him use to kick it and Bag's baby moms died giving birth
Cause of Sickle-cell problems
And Shamik from Lefrak would bring me Red Lobster
I never knew they was coming, they would just pop up
My niggas; you stunt on us, we shoot people
Straight like that, no half step, I eat you
Alive with this .4/5 mag-i-num
Stay on your toes cause we toe-tagging 'em

We ain't goin platinum (nope) we ain't goin gold
We goin diamond - ten million sold
We break records (records) and move units, that's how we do it
(Do it do it) Makin millions and billions from movies and music
World tourin, shows, performin
The deals, the budgets, accounts, enormous
We got it (got it) you frontin, you need it, you want it
The Mobb, and Bars, and Hooks, we comin
Delorean, and Mr. Bars, how about that?
We some Queensbridge niggas that ain't all about rap
We own streets, run websites, log on
To the one and only, InfamousStores.com
We load up the tour buses, to get these checks
We independent, we don't need your respect
We +Infamous Minded+, you've been blinded
It's Bars & Hooks nigga, we.. goin.. diamond!

Yeah, what more do y'all want from us?
We spill our hearts out and it still ain't enough
Years we got crumbs, doin the supplyin
We independent now - we.. goin.. diamond!
Yeah, what more could you ask for?
We the team, we deserve everything and more
All the blood and sweat for our dead we stopped cryin
Swallowed it, survived it - we.. goin.. diamond!

You might catch me steppin out the Lamborghini
With ashy legs, my chain swingin
I grab my piece, so that shit won't damage the paint
Chest naked holdin a drink
We got these hoes by the brain, we black rap moguls
We the most poppin, we the illest niggas rhymin
Let's go team for team, you don't want that
We make niggas quit rap, we so violent
The only thing that calm us down is more dollars
We need NBA cash, the yachts, the labs
The Porsche, Ferrari, the Hummer, you mad?
AK-90, the sigs, the macs
Grenades, silencers, sterlings that blast
To Linden, the sweeper to murder yo' ass
You doubted my niggas (WORD) now we up
Yeah, you musta been wildin - we.. goin.. diamond!


We gon' kill 'em with this here, and ship ten million
This year, look on the charts it's there
At the number one spot, locked of course
By these ghetto street pharmacist entrepeneurs
Who woulda thought? The car I always wanted get bought
Sittin on ten times twos, rollin by you
It gets bigger, I remember bein broke
So the plan now is to get richer
Ain't gon' be no scufflin my nigga, I ain't gon' fight ya
I'mma pay the piper to snipe ya, it's real like that
Goin diamond make you feel like that
Cause I done been through the bullshit, dealt with the bullshit
Now I'm lampin, mansion, and a few whips
Ain't nothin but a thug thing, this the club theme
Bars & Hooks to H.N.I.C. we climbin
Finally we shinin - we.. goin.. diamond!

Fuck y'all niggas man
We goin diamond.. we goin diamond..
Knahmsayin? Move these units.. do these shows..

I be the same nigga.. (get rich nigga)
Uh-huh, get yours nigga, get yours nigga..
We take yours nigga..

Yo, yo I can see it Dunn, yo let's be it Dunn
And we can manifest all the cash we ever dreamed of
It's the cream I love, for the team I shove
All fakeness and everything else to far away from us
Ain't no discussin for the plush life
My niggas go hard and knock y'all down to survive
In this jungle, wilderness, we was raised
By the wolves and the scavengers, instincts like a animal
But it toughened us, put a whole lot of thug in us
And it paid off, cause can't none of y'all fuck with us
Don't get it twist, I know, anyone can get touched
But uhh - my style of Dunn is too quick to bust
And too swift to just, talk in angles to
Let me straighten that shit out for you, peep it
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, the best kept secret
We killers, but chill Dunn (shhh) that's best kept secret
Let's not jump off the topic, we talkin bout cash
Fuckin with mines'll be, much more than your ass
So many years and tears and blood and sweat that fell
This dirt underneath my fingernails speak for itself
I be the same if I had billions
You couldn't understand my pain if you lived it
Give me the riches, and all of my Dunns'll be drivin
It's beautiful to see the click, live comfortable
{*Chorus: Prodigy and B.G.*}
 To the Young Black Entrepeneurs
 Get rich, get money, get paper, get paid
Keep yourself laced, and get your ones
Get your Dunns out the slums

 Get dollars, get cash, straight up don't get fucked
Get your bucks, and get big
Stash your first millions and live off the interest
 To the Young Black Entrepeneurs

When I hit the block, pistol on my side, bundle of dope in my socks
Dime bags of powder, sack of twenty dollar rocks
I'mma hustler, I was taught be bout green
Therefore, I got to have it by all means
I be thuggin, B.G. was raised that way
Can't see me bein a ho, you'll get played that way
If I'm broke, you got coke, unhands that yay
Be a man, don't break it off, gotta blast that K
Drama, I love that, I bring that shit
Dick get hard off that shoot-em-up and bang bang shit
I'm Mobb Deep, with this click that I'm with, believe that
Disrespect us if you want, we bang for feedback
Glock got a bad mouth, when it start it don't stop
Black talons go straight through the heart and close shop
I'mma guerilla, I run with jackers and gangsters
Convicted felons, and believe we armed and dangerous
It gets real, I'm prepared for whatever it come to
Let me catch ya with your drawers down, I'mma down you
Police will find you in a project dumpster
Withcha dick cut off, stuffed in your mouth motherfucker
I don't care, about you or no nigga that you fuck with

Reggae,Prodigy of Mobb Deep,2008,H.N.I.C. Pt. 2,I Want Out,"I was just telling Hav'
These young'n's is over wilding two shootings in two days
And none of it over dollars, have my mind zoned
Somewhere in a different time zone
Y'all can stand under building, I'm tryna buy homes
But I ponder it gradually grab me back, you can put me anywhere
In the world and ill adapt, look
I'm tired of flying to label reps like my niggas all ready to eat
The table's set, I'm tired of corner standing
Piffin the same exit, keep it real I want hills my ninja
Change settings, I want a backyard where pookie can play
I don't care if it cost my life nigga shoot me today
Remember going to the store momma told me to keep the change
I wanna jump in something new tell my momma to keep the Range
My man got shot I had to peddle him home
He couldn't take the pain and caught a heroin jones

This is it I want out
This usually part of the movie where the pistol comes out
Like I said I need change
I need a whole lot of this money and little bit of fame
It's like a ghetto tell tales
I'm tired of camouflaging the corner let me get the next sale
I'm really tryna prosper of a good good rap
Before I leave out the hood I take a good look back

They say, what don't kill you will kid it'll only make you stronger
And the wrong mistake is a half dead ass doing the coroner
Heavenly father I'm looking into the heavens
My girl think I'm going crazy this nigga going 7th
These days you know the hammer under the pillow
Got a mansion left from the ghetto I'm trapped in the middle
So niggas layed flat like soda without the fizzle
When it rained it poured be lucky it only drizzled
Took my homie under my brella I took him in
He bit me turned around and told me thats how a snake wins
The world we livin in... can't trust a homie far as I can shoot a nigga
Leave me the shit get lonely, homie
Dont speak my name if you don't know me
Most important you *black* the bitches dat shits is corny
Out ya rabid ass mind tryin to run up on me
Don't make have to shoot you wit the 40


Yo, thun, I be right back, yeah hold it down G's
While I'm gone get me songs all over the streets
Thats what you call awareness, these niggas put they lil albums out
But nobody cares it's P time to shine
Get dat shit the fuck outta hea I satisfy the custi's
My history at retail, is outstanding
My cd got wings cause it flys off the shelves
While I'm stuck in the bing for the next 80 days
Fuck it I got years it can't get no worse than it already is
I spoke to my nigga Yayo the other day
He told me everybody bumpin H.N.I.C., part 2
And on the youtube, I'm killin'm out there, crazy views
I make a rapper run for his life and drop a gem
This nigga threw his watch so we would stop chasin him
He lucky I was on trial, I woulda stabbed him, he was saw from every angle
All them cameras. fuck it I still won, still undefeated
This nigga tryin to act like he did something, beat it
Your not a gangsta its been proven
Nah, you just a snitch like Frank Lucas
Yous a false prophet, out in the world
While a real nigga like me trapped in a cell"

Sorry if wasn't perfect when you thought I should've been

I encourage my self to be better and master the art, its
Long time coming seem like the other day
I'm just being myself, they calling me a late bloomer (what?)
And I don't know if that's a compliment or insult
And I don't give a fuck really keep talking
Got two pair of watch like the Polo, kid

On a silly bitch like you and miss my chance
To realize my greatness and become who I am (beat it)

Reggae,Prodigy of Mobb Deep,2011,The Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson EP,Twilight (The Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson EP),"Francine Hughes: You shot three people, don't you have any remorse?
Bumpy Johnson: Remorse comes when you feel you've done something wrong
Francine Hughes: You don't think killing is wrong?
Bumpy Johnson: Innocent people? Yes
There's been thirty five lynchings this year alone
Depression got people starvin' all over the country
Scottsboro Boys in the jail for a crime they didn't commit
All of that is wrong
Francine Hughes: Yeah, I understand all that
Bumpy Johnson: But?
Francine Hughes: But I don't understand you
You're a perfect gentleman, you're a poet
You're nice to people, you-you think about things

Bumpy Johnson: Is there nothing in this world that you love enough, that you would kill for it or die for it?

Yeah
When darkness consumes the neighborhood streets
The neighborhood hoods and the neighborhood creeps
Come out to play with they hats pulled down
And their hoodies pulled low below they eyebrows
Take yo ass in the crib you not down for madness
'Bout to go down three at night
Night shift workers come home they walk fast
Scared to go through they own block, yeah, it's that bad
The villains making a killin' sellin' pieces of weight
E&J inside a hot chamomile tea
Keep em warm 'cause the cold air'll cut your skin
It's bleedin' outside but the block still clickin'
There's cameras in the hood but the fiends still smoke
The narcs makin' movies
They lookin' for the role of the worlds dumbest criminal caught on film while the real criminal minds continue to thrive in

The hood in the twilight you hear guns bark
Street lamps gettin' shot out to keep the block dark
We post up in the blackness of the shadows
Where only crackheads and dope fiends dare travel
Where police enter at they own risk
If you not from this hood get yo ass out the bricks
Most bodies get caught at night
You'll be chokin' on blood starin' up at the stars in the twilight

It's 2012 and drugs still movin'
The balance don't stop and the prisons is full with scar-faced thugs
C's and B's, who do years and come back to the same routine
Some say the game over, they must be blind
Bet they don't come through the real hoods at night
With that theoretical shit, you shit your drawers
You'll get robbed for your outfit, yeah, take that off
Disparity rules the world, the rich is outnumbered
You can't straddle the fence, pick a side, fucker
You got 'til the sun go down 'cause when that full moon rise then the wolves come out
And the cocaine vampires slingin' hard white from dusk to dawn
It's nothin' like the movies
We drink holy water, rock crucifixes, and eat garlic and onion chips for dinner

The hood in the twilight you hear guns bark
Street lamps gettin' shot out to keep the block dark
We post up in the blackness of the shadows
Where only crackheads and dope fiends dare travel
Where police enter at they own risk
If you not from this hood get yo ass out the bricks
Most bodies get caught at night
You'll be chokin' on blood starin' up at the stars in the twilight

Yeah and this is right up my alley, P
Likewise, won't let a nigga straddle me
Pull up the cavalry, the salary is runnin' low
 at his throat, now tell me what I wanna know
I need addresses, how to access it
You know it's somethin' if you got that nigga Hav stressin'
Your mans know I got him stockin' up on mad vestes
I been down this road so this my last ditch effort
No homo, everybody get naked
Play hero, I spin you like a hit record
My goons bipolar, eyes over shoulder, and, how ironic, more gruesome when I'm sober
Nocturnal, won't rest 'til I learn you
Taste pussy, got a bitch in your guy circle
I send shots at your cop Colonel
Talkin' all that fly shit that's what it'll earn you

The hood in the twilight you hear guns bark
Street lamps gettin' shot out to keep the block dark
We post up in the blackness of the shadows
Where only crackheads and dope fiends dare travel

Them niggas stay
Infamous minded
U've been blinded
Cut on your face
Fucking with these mobb giants
They are the victims
We be the victors
Sometime a nigga gotta step up
And bring war, Spray ks
And go out in a blaze
Young guns learn to duck
So they won't catch strays
Won't shoot to be frontin'
Or to waste shots for nothin
If I'm pulling out my torch
Im gonn hit somethin', Whatever
Slugs through your avirex leather
I close one lid
So I could aim a little better
I stop firing
And  de-cock the hammer
You need triads
I need to get up outta here
Dont really think It's cool to let another man
""Let me buck that nigga son""
I hold my own cannon and shoot just as fast
Move with select few
Dont fuck with lil dude
Or little pistols
Strictly the big Ru's
Cause deuce-deuce its only good for hiding
I need big firepower when I'm riding
52 shot clips
You pop lips, Silence
And i dont stop dumping till i hear sirens
I'm not a Boyz N The Hood addict
Menace fanatic
I live the street life for real
So I can brag it
Pop gave me gun lesson back when I was a kid
Now I fire more arms than he ever did
Thats why
I keep things in proper prospective
And every album point y'all niggas in the right direction
There's  no protection, when I'm on the mike
You couldn't fold me
If you trained all your life
You's a chump, I'm a champ
You broke, I'm top dollar
Niggas gotta whole lotta mouth
Thats no problem
Fake thugs lay down
Real killers dont yell it
Bring it don't sing it nigga
Use intelligence
Its evident you not, murder material
When you all alone, you pose guns in the mirror yo
Chinky, Rapper Noyd, Hav, G part 3, my nigga Bino and Nitty
Y'all feel me
Let me get deeper in the subject
Cause its gets me hard
Every nigga holding
Dont mean he gonn arc
Any nigga that show it
Need to disown it
Or get it tooken by another who deserve it
Listen, this is what it takes to survive today
Use your eyes, to my niggas thats ride with me
And you see that nigga P, be the storm quiet
Im holding, so ease back
I stay infamous minded
Yeah yeah nigga, shit is real
You know
Infamous minded
Yo, this niggas outhere
We moving blindly dun, its all about survival though
They don't know
You the top dawg for the rest to follow
Infamous minded
You know how we do it killer
The Qb way, my way or no way
Queensbrige to our death day
Infamous minded
Shit, why you think they call us infamous nigga
We earned the title nigga
Not cause it sounds tough dumb fuck
Infamous minded

When the bridge start rocking
The bridge, It keep rocking
When the bridge start rocking
The mobb'll keep rocking
When the bridge start rocking
Queens still be rocking
When the bridge start rocking
My niggas keep popping"

No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11

Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire

Reggae,Beyoncé,2008,I Am... Sasha Fierce,If I Were a Boy,"If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy..."

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

Reggae,Beyoncé,2013,BEYONCÉ,Pretty Hurts,"Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well my aspiration in life would be... to be happy

Mama said, ""You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters""

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better

Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

Ain’t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?
You stripped away the masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)"
Reggae,Beyoncé,2006,B’Day,Listen,"Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened

There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own"

Reggae,Beyoncé,2013,BEYONCÉ,Haunted,"Part 1: Ghost

(The winner is Beyoncé Knowles: female pop vocalist!)
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston

And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

Probably won't make no money off this, oh well

I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest

Take it one step further, freakum dress out my closet
Yoncé fillin' out this skirt, I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow

And I hate us for making good love to each other

Introduce you to some new things, and upgrade you

Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals

I'll be the help, whenever you need me (You need me)

It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (hehe)

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oh and you
You, and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
Oh-oh, and you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back too
You go back too

I, I loved you much
It's not enough
I love blowing you a love puff
And life, is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

But now everything you told me really don't apply to the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy, once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
And I tried, and I tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I'll always remember feeling like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than another, more than my own life
But that part of me I gave you, it was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinking, ""What's up with B?""
I been crying for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she's had half of me
How could you lie?"

Reggae,Beyoncé,2008,I Am... Sasha Fierce,Ave Maria,"She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
There for the grace of God go, I

I found Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria

Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands, baby, you got to understand

You are my Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside

Reggae,Beyoncé,2003,Dangerously In Love,"Me, Myself and I","All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin'
Everything is cool between us Bey
I told you that
Out on the road with my people, just doin' what I gotta do
There’s nothing going that shouldn't be goin' on
You gotta trust me, Ma

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

So controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over, stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

I know that I will never disappoint myself

Reggae,Lupe Fiasco,2012,"Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album, Pt. 1",Bitch Bad,"Yeah, I say, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Now imagine there's a shorty, maybe five, maybe four
Riding 'round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now, I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along, and this what she says
""Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch!
Somethin' that's far above average.""
And maybe other rhyming words like ""cabbage"" and ""savage""
And ""baby carriage"" and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin' here
First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama, comma
And because she's relatin' to herself
As most important source of help
And mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Uh, tell 'em, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
They misunderstood
They misunderstood

Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through 12
On the Internet watching videos, listening to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents
Now, being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
""Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches.""
Now, let's say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah, the plot thickens: high heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin'
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)

Disclaimer: this rhymer, Lupe, is not using ""bitch"" as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection
‘Cause while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sho' enough, in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house, hot mess like that
Ass, titties, dressed like that, all out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
""Bad"" mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But ""bad"" mean bad to him, ""bitch"" don't play a part
But ""bitch"" still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch – what a double entendre!

Tell 'em, bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
You're misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, greatest motherhood
(I'm killin' these bitches)"
Reggae,Lupe Fiasco,2015,Tetsuo & Youth,Mural,"We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living? And cherry picking
Every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother, hurled
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay playing at the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
But reign like Queens that reign over made man
And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen
But Queen, like white glove wave hand, and not wave hand, like it's a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand, I'm talking wave, like you saying, ""Hey man!""
And not hay for horses, and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords, like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words, like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting, that I was poor,but now I'm more than (poor)
It's still hooker heels, on my sugar hills, and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims, from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows, for my peep pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out, like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise, when the beat drops, and the sun dies, when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapsed, then it detox
Then heat back, like a heat pack, on his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got, like yeah
Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching, nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water-boarding, Barbie doll
A river of women, like a Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis, made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position, was black condition, and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they're not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside an Apple prison
Chicken hackin’ down-lowed updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
Uhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position, or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition, against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves, out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerve storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet, like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration, so that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers, to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buckaroo roof painting tunnels, onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces out a count of lies
Chocula Counts, by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who’s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging rain and catching hail
Faces need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real still til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!"
Reggae,Lupe Fiasco,2012,"Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album, Pt. 1",Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),"First off, say ""Peace"" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine stripper mad dash
A friend request following a hash tag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillacs

Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death

Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for ""Thriller""
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the middle
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…

Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need

With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets

I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, And a bunch of other coverups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of ""what the fucks""
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homey, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either

I can't take back the words I never said

Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become an actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash them down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said"
Reggae,Lupe Fiasco,2012,"Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album, Pt. 1",Lamborghini Angels,"It's a mad world out here, I tell you
The world's gone stark, raving mad
Everyone in the world is mad
It's a mad crazy world

I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
Listen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause
A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
Shun him while in public disallow him from your stores
Have no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours
Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
But we must still pray that his color will be cured

I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

With her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
He looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains
How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
From the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims
To do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane
You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
You torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame
Blank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name
Perfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints
May God bless the scientific cure for the insane
Knew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change

I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

With his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
Put his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
Told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
Now the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time
With no life inside his body now he finally think he’s safe
But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
Doesn’t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
He forgives them in advance says that he will do again

My fellow Americans...

Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh (the return)
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to catch his microphone, check 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me, standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me, I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too
Ha ha ha ha-ha-ha

If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh, yeah

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down to the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China, nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five, unless it's pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gonna clap and they ain't gonna praise
They want everything back that they've paid
Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha-ha-ha

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

So chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha ha ha-ha-ha
Ha ha ha-ha-ha, ha""

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

If you are, what you say you are

Low on energy, find peach cobbler then gobble it, yeah
It's food in them drums and boxes
If you beat 'em up then they'll drop it
And they'll rapidly flicker till they disappear
Blinking gradually quickens 'til they isn't here

With both controllers watchin' Gazans and Ashkenazis ride roller coasters
Say yeah, yeah, lots of options, now up is down, two player
Now A is jump and B is punch, you seein' somethin' that wasn't there
To find friendliness in a nemesis, it's a old test
Three buttons, see somethin', that's emphasis on Genesis, oh yeah

Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby

Can't be eyes closed when you side scroll
You not the first person
The first person from your first curse until your first cursive
And your curse words is in the curve version
It occurs virgin is the word version
That refers perfect to the first person
In the third verse, who's really me
In the third person but prefers the first one
That's me, again
Master cleanse in a syringe
From a gerber until your first burger
Pamper to her depends
Everything between is just drawers
Even in between is no loss
Even where the king is no boss
Meet it with a swing it's so south, yeah
Unless you Bamm Bamm
Knocking them pitches into the grand stands
In the club, watching the women just do them handstands
Like you a man's man
That's washing down a ham with the Zam Zam
Who got a baby in here with these strippers?
She's two weeks pregnant
Didn't even know, he's dancing with her, damn...

The King
When you’re king of African music you’re the King
Because music is the king of all professions
(N.U. Music)

Best laid plan, make a mess, made
Damnation, let's play hands, sans spades
That's without, a boycott and a sit-out
Afro-Black pick in with a fist out
From the ""Welcome Home"" to the kick out
Reach into a rabbit, pull a trick out
Preacher preaching to a faggot with his dick out
Hard times call for armed time, hmm
Sick, sick, sick eyes from the nose pressure
Police snip zip ties on the protesters
Six wives in the fry of a molester
Met him at a caviar bar out in Odessa
Dirty needles breaking all the old records
A hundred hoes, one shovel and some old treasure
Ole Zeke use teeth as a gold tester
Finger rolls, finger waves, closet full of old leathers
Old sweaters, old boots, that's a whole suit for some cold weather
New sale, two L's and some old letters
Now he doing double life, while she lead a double life
Man, he need another wife
New approach might help a nigga bowl better
New hoes might help a nigga hold together
Or will the new lane lead em' to the same pen?
And the hunger strike in em' to the same tin

Love is looking over various errors
And hate is habitually accelerating terror
Everywhere, but the mural
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I don't wanna be accepted; not as all as I am
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, land

Getting slammed from the protest, no food
Force fed him like OB with a nose tube
Visions say consult the yogi with the gold shoes
With the Rollie going bowling for the old school
(Yeah) I need more for the Michaels
That's a loss for the class and a score for the rifles
Three hots and a cot and some cops
Trying to find dinosaurs in the Bible
It's all quiet in the jailhouse
Then they ride in to find the empty cells out
They was looking for the swords
They was looking for the swords
I'm just looking at they feet cause I'm looking for the Lord
Looking in the library, looking at the law
10 years deep, now I'm looking at the bar
Claim sovereignty cause I'm bunkin' with the Moors
They degenerate, they ain't looking at the game
They just looking at the scores, they be putting on my books
Cause I'm looking at the stars, trade a shank for some crank
Now I'm looking at a war, BGF got the yard
AB got the kitchen, snitches on PC
M&M on a mission but C.O.'s got the prison
God got us all, God set us free
God is the key, but the guards got the doors

Punching on the glass
Scared that some killer might fuck him in the ass
Staff getting rigid, wasn't gon' take away the visits
Segregate niggas by theyself and make 'em stay with it
Wicked, swung the shank around on a mop string
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT team
That's a cop team
They sent hella cops to stop, the helicopteriiiing...
Man, he'd thought that he'd fly away
Like a kite, take flight, like a letter on a string
Like propellers on a wing (but the kite was the key)
They made electric chairs for his dying days
Last meals, no appeals for him to try and stay
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac
Maybe he could dig a tunnel outta A Block
And wear gloves for the razor-wired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box
Looking at the world through the TV
And they gone, rapping over beats from the tabletops
Ay! That's how it is in a police state
When your life is just a number and release date
When you're rehabilitated so correctly
And let's hope that's how you're living when you're set free

Dreadlocks nooses hang from his neck as the new Jim Crow
Corporations feed him seeds yet unborn

And answers that I leave in empty pages to be written
Where is your pen? The new Jim Crow

In the prison stripping niggas phone rights
Got a malice, on the other side of the bars
Watching niggas get smart, watching niggas get strong
Watching niggas get home, he jail us
But deep down he jealous
With each sweep down, he tell us
With each beat down, he help us
Wrong one gon' knock his ass out though
It's why he gotta lock all the niggas out for
Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound?
It's why they treat niggas like shit

Which means I'm tearless, which means my iris
Resides where my ears is, which means I'm blinded
But I'ma find it, I can feel its nearness
But I'ma veer, so I don't come near
Like a chicken or a deer, but I remember
I'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness
The windshield is menstrual, the whole grill is roadkill
So trill and so sincere, yeah, I'm both them there
Took both pills when the bloke in the trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost or a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as Rosie, pockets full of posies
Given to the mother of the deceased
Awake and at war 'til I'm resting in peace

It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear
Of a stewardess in a Lear, she's fine and she's flying
I feel I'm flying by 'em, cause my mind's on cloud nine
And in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the Underground King
Who's also Klingon, to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks, but I Sphinx like Leon
Or lion in the desert
I'm flying on Pegasus, you're flying on a pheasant
Writer of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers
Spit, ""hot fiya"" like Dylan on Chappelle's skit
Yeah, smell it on my unicorn
Don't snort the white horse, but toot my own horn

They're trying to graduate from school, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're startin' to think that smart is cool, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're trying to get up out the hood, Lu (Dumb it down!)
I'll tell you what you should do (Dumb it down!)

And I'm brainless, which means I'm headless
Like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplay-less sex is, which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang the chain with
Which makes me necklace-less, like a necklace theft
And I ain't used my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the best-fed F-F jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues; my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas
Westside Poseidon, Westside beside 'em
Chest-high and rising, almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make ya fly with
Personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves
David Blaine, make it rain
You make a boat, I make a plane
Then, I pull the plug and I make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again
Westside!

You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine

Where the golden means, so the overseer gets overseen
And the over here's are the older things
Can see the bell but don't know the rings
The rings are not sounds, but circles
Wear these on your virtues
See through these circles just like Steve Urkel
Till it's all universal
And it harmonize in like proportion to the larger size
And it's dynamic in the high standard
So each degree has a part to price
See big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity
And little whirls have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity

You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine

The applause of patrons at the laws in nature
Override lies and the laws of nations
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations
Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plumb decisions
Perpendicular to the undivision
That's bad curricular to the unconditioned
Any love less than unconditional is so
Under-Christian, it's unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told it's the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The soul's gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half

You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be

What up, y'all? Yeah
(Soundtrakk, what's poppin', baby?)
Woo! (Ugh)
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
(Kick, push, coast)
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here (Uproxx...)
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about? (Woo!)
So, check it out, uh

First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah
When they said ""It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here""

And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

So let's kick... (Ugh)
And push (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)
And coast
Uh, uh, uh (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)

My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said ""Bow!
I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds"" (Woo!)
""Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here""

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast... (Yeah, ugh!)
(Haha, swanky)
Yeah, yeah!

Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said...)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head... to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh!
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, ""There's no skating here""

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)

As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep him happy 'cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sitting on the shoulders, but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news cameras filming this walking project building
Now there's hoes selling holes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's a car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest, I'm sitting in my room

We need a few more half-naked women up in the pool
And hold this MAC-10 that's all covered in jewels
And can you please put your titties closer to the 22s?
And where's the champagne? We need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain, slow-motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the baby's sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tip-toe 'round, creeping
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see, had the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me

Yeah, this one right here, ha
I dedicate this one right here
To everybody out there…
Ya dig?
Check it out

Now I ain't trying to be the greatest—
I used to hate hip-hop, yup, because the women degraded
But Too $hort made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite, I stated, though I only recited half
Omitting the word ""bitch""– cursing, I wouldn't say it
Me and Dog couldn't relate, till a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learned it from a song I heard and sort of liked
Yeah, further, ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac
Nas' It Was Written, intermixed with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom, and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world, and listen
It dropped

My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
And I got no place to go
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it hurts me soul

I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
'Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinking ""Golly, God guard me from the ungodly""
But by my 30th watching of Streets is Watching
I was back to giving props again, and that was bothering
'Bout as uncomfortable as an untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustle to seemed wrong
But these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into
And thought; what constitutes a prostitute
Is the pursuit of profit, then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things
With the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said ""Don't knock it, mind your business""
His business isn't mine and that nigga pimping, got it

They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, their cross on fire
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced
So I got no place to go
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang time
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me
Turn off my TV 'cause it hurts me soul

So through the Grim Reaper sickle-sharpening
Macintosh marketing, oil field auguring
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation, Islamic martyrdom
Precise, yeah, laser-guided targeting
Oil for food bartering, terrorist organization harboring
Sand-camouflaged army men
CCF sponsoring, world conquering, telephone monitoring
Louis Vuitton modeling, pornographic actress honoring
String theory pondering, bulimic vomiting
Catholic Priest fondling, preemptive bombing
And Osama and Obama and them
They breaking in my car again
Deforestation and overlogging, and
Hennessy and Hypnotiq swallowing
Hydroponic coughing, and
All the world's ills
Sitting on chrome 24-inch wheels
Like that

They say I'm infected, this is why I inject it
I had it aborted, we got deported
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here
But I got no place to go
I can't stop eating, my best friend's leaving
My pastor touched me, I love this country
I lost my earpiece, I hope y'all hear me
'Cause it hurts me soul

It hurts me soul
It hurts me soul

He said, ""I write what I see
Write to make it right, don't like where I be
I'd like to make it like the sights on TV
Quite the great life, so nice and easy""
Sí, now you can still die from that
But it's better than not being alive from straps
Agreed, a Mead notebook
And a Bic that click when it's pushed
And a wack-ass beat — That's a track that's weak
That he got last week
Cause everybody in the stu' was like, ""That's that heat""
A bass-heavy medley, with a sample from the 70s
With a screwed-up hook that went ""stack that cheese""
Somethin'-somethin'-somethin'; ""stack that cheese""
Mother, sister, cousin; ""stack that cheese""
He couldn't think of nothin'; ""stack that cheese""
He turns down the beat, writer's block impedes
Crying from the next room, a baby in need
Of some Pampers and some food and place to sleep
That, plus a black Cadillac on Ds
Is what keep him on track to be a great MC

Producer made him take it down, said he had to pay
Open mic champ two weeks in a row
Ex D-boy with a B-boy flow
Glow like Leroy, you should see boy go
Got a daddy serving life and a brother on the row
Best homie in the grave, tatted up while in the cage
Minute Maid got his momma working like a slave
Down baby mama who he really had to honor
‘Cause she was his biggest fan, even let him use her Honda
To drive up to Dallas, went to open up for amateurs
Let him keep a debit card so he could put gas in it
Told her when he get on he gon' take her to the Galleria
Buy her everything but the mannequins, ya dig?

His man called, said ""Your time might be now
They played your freestyle over 'Wipe Me Down'
They played it two times, said it might be crowned
As the best thing out the H-Town in a while""
He picked up his son with a great big smile
Rapped every single word to the newborn child
Then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
And put on another beat and got back to the mission of
Get his momma out the hood, put her somewhere in the woods
Keep his lady looking good, have her rolling like she should
Show his homies there's a way, other than that flippin' yay
Bail his homie out of jail, put a lawyer on his case
Throw a concert for the school, show the shorties that it's cool
Throw some candy on the Caddy, chuck the deuce and act a fool
Man, it feels good when it happens like that

See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't fear it so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it

Were no reconstructions, civil war got avoided

Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as an old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Qu'ran

Eminem fitted in, but then again
He inspired a black rapper tryin' to mimic him
And that's what really rose up out of Michigan

But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make it fast or we can make it last

I trick, I fall, run up in raw

Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness, status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene, an obscene obsession for the bling

She would make me cool, and we would both rule, forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever again
And if the rain stops, and everything's dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'd teach me how to fly, even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky

You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons' abs
I'm telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
The system is a slab, corruption is the swinger
Sitting high riding dirty, drag racing into danger
And it's so clean, pine trees smelling good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I can't shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor

Would you look at how they swing?
They ain't dead though
No, I didn't die y'all, I cut myself down
And I admire my fall, into grace

Now as I wander through the city going mad
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag
Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doing bad
Then the separation from the truth is getting vast, fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money, delighted by the dummying
Down of the importance of crowns we'll never have
That's why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft

Hating on your happiness you hit 'em off with laughs
Smile 'til they surrender, then you kill 'em off with glad

I got my chopper full and my black tee, slide
My baby mama done fucked up on her food stamps
That’s three months to re-certify
I’m ridin', niggas be watching, they don’t want these problems
When them bills due, niggas get ready cause no bullshit, I'm plottin'
I’m a government baby, let me get my cheese, let me get my cheese
Got a seven-trey in my mama yard, sittin' on D's
I’m 'bout this fee, I’m 'bout this fee, just know what’s free
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, so don’t critique
Look at me nigga, just a young hood nigga, tryna get this cake
I don’t need to be givin’ out how school gon’ educate
Filet mignon for my food stamps, I know mama credit quite good
So I’m out here with this dope money, got a big body in my hood
Nigga you see it, better believe it, this what I’m 'bout
Got a trap house that be boomin', nigga, fiends in and out
Cut the check, anyway it come, nigga, Section 8
See we straight, see this money I make, this block can stay, ha

Yeah bitch, filet mignon with my food stamps
Would tell you I don’t but it won't be the truth
Let me hit you back on my government phone
Still a hood nigga, whatcha want me to do?
We get a blunt and a joint out a sawbuck and loud
Where I’m from we be actually hoopin’ in Jordans
Five dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes
Ain’t nobody finna do shit important
People really don’t give no fuck about nothing
Although they may smile and be cordial
Dealin’ around with the wrong damn crowd
Then bring a frown to my friend, I'm in an alley, we warned you
Background check for the chopper
The barrel breathin' back down the neck of imposters
The murder rate ain’t back down yet
Cause they ain't wrote that down yet to the nigga that was tryna say somethin’
Some people, listen
You could be predisposed or be preconditioned
Or speak with the preacher, been preaching, be the person
To put some process in your progress or be the prevention
I just live my life and I don’t stop grindin' until God tell me to
I get money, I ain’t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?
They say my kind ain’t welcome everywhere, well I can deal with that
But those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them
It's still a fact
So mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine
You’ll solve you'll find that this is
Best for everyone involved, all in all, the Lord my witness

Permit, don’t need permission from a doctor
I been smokin’ since a pre-teen toddler
I been servin’ since a jit, tryna dodge all the obstacles
My teachers all told me that were probable
Probable cause, no cracker never really had it
I was just a nigga in a high price whip
Yeah, I’m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto
Where you better have extension on the clip
Well beef comes around in the town
More often than these bitches' emotions
I got a yopper, five dollars, off the streets (yeah I'm totin')
For protection more than anything though (you gon' test my devotion)
My first amendment right, they violate it anytime we outspoken
Chicago violence boostin’ up but we just focusin’
On other environments cause the country taking notice
More fiends are risin', molly the new dope
And I apologize cause it was something I was promotin’
Chopper in my bitch name in case I light somebody up
You just tell them it was stolen
Rich gunplay, shit that’s all they see, that’s all they know
Without it kinda hopeless
Said this in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said all their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me, ""Trouble, you gotta put the mac down
Felonies all in your background""

I used to run up in your crib with shit that go blocka
Nigga tryna brick my squad like I’m Waka
I don’t wanna see no chain I can’t rock-a
Heard 'em tell me life is a bitch, can’t stop her
Even if I could, I tell 'em I wouldn’t knock her
'Til I get that Section 8 and then swap her
Baby mama tax return, new dropper
I might wanna go silk that bitch like I’m Shocker
All of my whips wetter than a water house
Food stamps getting flipped, what that water cost?
Yeah I’m actin like a nigga that ain’t never had shit
Filet mignon, porterhouse
My little brother on his medical shit from that block street
Nigga healthcare insured by that guap
Doorways ain't hiding me, no stop
Jackers playin’ open season with they yop
Shit I probably be the same, I find drama
Law's out lookin’ for me like Osama
I don’t wanna do no bid, Your Honor
Still waitin’ on my one phone call from Obama
Tell ‘em I need the chopper, they tellin’ me I'm a felon
I'm tellin' 'em they got it wrong, I beat the case in '9-7
And I'm well acquainted with hell but I’m tryna make it to heaven
But they don’t want me to make it, that’s why the niggas be tellin'
If I don’t get the chopper, I’ma probably run up inside
They better gimme a answer, I’m tryna be cool
If I don’t get it then everybody gon’ fear it
Every week I’m finna make ‘em repeat it like they in school
Bad news, everybody open up somethin’
You can move all you want just not sudden

Storm is gone now it’s all clear
The road was long but we all here
Now go and tell, I don’t care
2014 is our year
Big shout out to the whole streets
This goes out to all that knows me
All y’all pussy niggas, hold these
Y’all play tough guys but call the police
Look I don’t care, I don’t share
I keep me a bad bitch with long hair
I send them choppers around there
When I’m somewhere sittin’ in a lounge chair
Overseas, blowin’ tree
Blowin’ green, throwin’ B's
Livin’ like life is supposed to be
And if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me
To the top, couldn’t stop
Had a major deal but it wouldn’t pop
Niggas hated on me but I wouldn’t stop
And now life sweeter than a puddin’ pop
Think you so slick? Come and get me dawg
None of y’all niggas fuckin' with me dawg
Some of y’all niggas comin' with me dawg
None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dawg
You thinkin' back-a-wards y'all
You need to think tactical dawg
We laughin’ at y’all
While you thinking me and Lu radical, naw
You seein' this shit that keep goin' on
Then pick a different zone for your mobile homes
Storing fingerprints on your mobile phone
When you sippin' that shit they keep pourin' on

I’m bout that, I’m bout that, that Bentley out in that driveway
Cost more than my house did, fuck land, I’m fly today
First class if I fly, credit card ain’t mine
Don’t know how I’m gettin’ back but in luxury I arrive (turn up)
IPhone in my baby name, long way from that chirp
Stripper pole in my bedroom, but I’ma kill my daughter if she twerk
I’ma kill my daughter if she twerk, Miley Cyrus on that bullshit
But a real nigga can’t judge, that for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college, missed out but no Pyrex
My Harley got low mileage (and this white carpet in my project)
Thirty guns in my section, none of the homies got aim
My side bitch said she pregnant, but I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game, I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
And this one is mine, I don’t trust his mama so he don’t got my name
Cheap rims on  my ride, mirrors loose as my beat pound
I ain’t addicted to shit, but weed man on my speed dial

Welfare baby can’t afford me
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried

Ayy, excuse me as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete myself
My opposition is not pretending
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself
Fuck being a hip-hop purist
When I'm  spendin’ 50 thousand on Securus
Embrace the contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It’s why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen can’t fill us, Medicaid can’t heal us
And the mamas can’t stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride
With an L up
Sayin' ""Free the guys"" like I'm Durk (them hittas!)
With a clean record but I’m cursed
To make a half a million off a verse

He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed a candy shop, told her ""Lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag, take the pennies out the drawer""
Lil Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck in the school is his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots, and black hair
He gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs, then we can get a soccer ball
That's what my commander say
How old? Well, I'm like 10, 11
Been fighting since I was like six, or seven
Now I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government want me dead so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher but I'm still too young
This candy give me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear
If I'm in your dreams then your end is near, it's me

Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A macabre parade of the toys he made
In shemaghs and shades, who look half his age
About half the size of the flags they wave
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
'Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a little loose
Where AK47s that they shooting into heaven
Like they tryna kill a Jetson that struggles little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, devoid of all childish  ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words that's on their own graves
Think you gangsta, popped a few rounds?
These kids'll come through and murder a whole town
Then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down
It's little weapon

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon, we're calling you
There's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use, little weapon
Little weapon, little weapon, we need you now, pow

Imagine if I had to console
The families of those slain I slayed on game consoles
I aim my hole, right trigger to squeeze
Press up and Y, one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs, press pause for your moms
Make the room silent, she don't approve of violent
Games; she leave, resume activity
Start in blue heart, subpar sharp wizardry
On next part, I insert code
To sweeten up the little person's murder workload
I tell him he work for CIA with A
A operative, I operate this game all day
I hold the controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder, he's only seconds older
Than me, we playful but serious
Now keep that on mind for online experience

He came back, in the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh to death
Bling, two earrings, a chain layin' on his chest
He still had it cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory, he didn't mind it
But, he couldn't sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just fillin' the casket up
Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second grade handwriting simply read, ""I miss ya""
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soakin'
He saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open
And he...

This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it
Working like a, hmm, reverse archaeologist
Except, his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped, six months after the shots
That'd got him in the box, wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours because he wasn't older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So, with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home
So he...

This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

He begged for some change to get him on the train
""Damn, that nigga stank"" is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look, wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter of fact, only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and gettin' back in his lane
Doin' his thang, first he had to find something to slang
Next stop was his block, it had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked that some lil' niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there so they pulled out
And robbed him with the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said, ""You're scared, ain't ya?""
He said, ""Hustler for death, no heaven for a gangsta""
And...

This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

Yeah, uhh
Cool!"

Ghettos, America. U.S. to the izzay
Killa in the citywide sprizzay
Where there's sunshine in the shizzade
Judge won't pull him out the pen like a grenade
For acting out their fears like a charade
Til they blacking out their tears like it's lights out
Bring em out the black like a lighthouse
And wave to em before they wiped out
Lifesaver, threw em, hope they catch it
But it's so Titanic to be iced out
That's just scratching the surface like Triple Axels
Want to roll around that Bentley like Crystal Castles
In addition to the chain
That's just to take the attention from the pain
Or is it the mission of the man
Audubon Ballroom, Motel Lorraine

Now white people, you can't say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people, we're not niggas
Cause God made us better than that

No break, all wake
Little mayhem for your All-State, nay ham, all steak
Get a good ball great like a golf grade
Make the ball break
Just one swing, no putting
That's how I try 'n does things, always
Especially when your past is
Martin, Baldwin, Audubon Ballroom
Turn the glass ceiling to a glass floor
Make a trampoline out of trapdoor
On that gasoline when I was back poor
Loudly crafted out my dream underneath a tap floor
Backpack battle-cat underground rap lore
Anonymous but dominant -- what's a Mac to a hacker?
In other words, we lyrical Zuckerbergs
Pimp you may move a mouse, but what's a rat to a cat store
It's like a gig to an app store
I rap Black history, you can only see my past if you fast forward

Now white people, you can't say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people, we're not niggas
Cause God made us better than that

Black Panthers, black anthems, black blues
With black answers for black stanzas: Langston Hughes
Breaking rules, ain't it cool?
Took it old, and made it new
Black painters, musical black anger
Black mothers, beautiful black anchors
So lets hear it for 'em! Let's hear it for 'em!
Lets hear it for 'em! Lets hear it for 'em!
Black America! Trap America!
'80s Babies! Crack America!
Rap America! Bad as Erykah!
From the era of family tearing up
But we just won big, can't be undid
Form a whole culture in just one kid
Miami dope boys, Oakland militants
Harlem Renaissance it's our deliverance

Now white people, you can't say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people, we're not niggas

Reggae,Lupe Fiasco,2012,"Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album, Pt. 1",Unforgivable Youth,"This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

With land on the horizon and passion in their eyes and
What they think are islands are much more in their size and
Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them
Supplies slim, morale once so heavily inside them
Now steadily declining
Return is not an option as necessity denies them
With this they choose to dive in
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving
Are the children of this land prepared to share in their surviving
A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
Not the material things of kings that could never last forever
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together
Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever
And stuck up on a pike up along the beach
Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs
And so began it here. And for five hundred years
Torture, terror, fear 'til they nearly disappear

This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

Ways and means from the trade of human beings
A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine
And helps the new regime establish and expand
Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land
From native caretakers who can barely understand
How can land be owned by another man?
Warns, ""One can not steal what was given as a gift;
Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish?""
But the lesson went unheeded, for the sake of what's not needed
You kill but do not eat it
The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it
The forests's were cleared, the factories were built
And all mistakes will be repeated
By your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatments
Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement
And in your rush to have the most, from the day you left your boats
You'll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts

This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep
They discover ancient cars on even older streets
And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth
They can tell that they were civil, not barbaric in the least
A society at peace. With liberty and justice for all
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade
Everything's so organized. They had to be well behaved
Assumed they had clean energy, little to no enemies
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
Religions kinda complex. Kinda hard to figure out
But this must be the temple
This White House

This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done

I gotta go pay these bills, I got a show to do, you know?
One time, for your mind

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Wherever I go she go

I love her, and I hate to leave her lonely
Ring-ring went the iPhone, it was my homie
He said, ""Let's hit Japan, if we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand, spend it in the south of France""
Nothing further; I jumped, grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
That's when I heard murder
""You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow
Sunrise, goodbyes, and missing you tomorrows""
I turn to see my dream, love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash, that's faster
Than 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Love, love

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

So let's keep it real, all in together, ""Free Chill""
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Don't wake me 'til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap, they applaud, they love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honoré, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been, and
Everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, umm

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

Guess who's back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams 'fore I went to sleep
To la-la land to count them sheep
I swear you're looking prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together, evermore
For better or, less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to you
But Ian said, ""Aloha"", and Harley said, ""Cheers""
Julian said, ""Bonjour"", Big O was like, ""Yeah!""
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, ""Pursue your interests 'cause even if I'm ticketless
I'll be there, by your side
In your heart, and on your mind""
So, as I taxi down another runway
I gotcha, who loves you bae
Now bring it back now

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home

Rollin' old models lowered old schools, flowin' cold
And goin' gold follows
Flower bearin', call it petals to the floor
Power sharin', call it devils to the door
Power, power, 'til ain't no devils anymore
Flower-flowers, they be droppin' at the feet of my sun
Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum
And who do I meet, to the beat of my drum?
It was little Susie Uzi, she sold crack and was a killer
All-bitch dope tip, wasn't trappin' with no niggas
Had a long money minor, do that action for them figures
Her influence fully automatic, crackin' off the Richter, yeah!
Walked up to my ride, asked me ""Could she get inside?""
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me, out here in the streets, she ain't have no competition
And with me up on them beats
Then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips, she said
""Now here's my proposition:
You just write a bunch of raps for me and I'ma go and spit 'em
Then we take 'em to the radio, the DJ better spin 'em
Then we take 'em to the record store
And sell a couple million,"" woo!

I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
We gotta gon' do it
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen

Uh, tell me call up Soundtrakk, have him send a couple beats
Not that ""Superstar"" shit, she wanted somethin' for the streets
Said it might take like a month, she said it better take a week
Gave my arm a little punch and then she pointed at her heat
Said, ""I saw that thing the first time, you don't gotta do it twice
But I need a lil' more info on exactly what I write
Some details 'bout a female, 'bout your life and what you like""
She said, ""My life is like a bitch, and I'm just like my life""
Then pow-pow-pow-pow-pow!
Yeah, them niggas started bustin'
Like that boycott was over and that ""we"" had overcome it
She said, ""Nigga, hit the gas,"" went from zero to a hundred
Now we runnin' from some killers, I was so sick to my stomach
She was hangin' out the window
With that thumper she was dumpin'
Had a look upon her face
That made me think that she was cummin'
We was swervin', jumped the curb
And ditched the whip and started runnin'
Tried to jump over a wall, but it was a little tall
So we ducked behind a bush and that's how we got overlooked
I was shook and breathin' hard
And she was sittin' there smokin' kush
Then we both started to glow, we looked around like, ""What is this?""
And then we looked up and a light
Came down and pulled us to a ship like, ""What the fuck?""

I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen (Shit!)

Well, now, this the shit I'm talkin' 'bout, the shit that I've been on
Yeah, lightyears outer space, but still a bitch feel right at home
Now where the bitches? Get them intergalactic asses to clappin'
Break down some of that candy
And roll it up in a wrapper for a rapper
Nah, I could never go back to trappin'
And who needs Atlanta when you're on Saturn gettin' a lap dance
With a lit match in your left hand and your right hand is a gas can
And at any given moment, I could burn this shit up
Why you standin' there just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up
Hop in some of this alien pussy, let me know how it work
I'm just sayin', I'm gon' be there and I ain't in no rush
(Nah nigga!) Nah nigga, I ain't in no rush

Ayy, I thought you couldn't rap, when you learn how to do that?
Then what you need me for, if you already know how to flow?
Ayy, fuck that, we gotta go, we'ldn't be in this hoe
If you told me from the jump we wouldn't be on this UFO
But I think that I can fly us, stole a key so I can try it
Never thought that I would ever be a flyin' saucer pilot
But first thing's gon' be first, when we get back to that earth
I'ma go back to them raps and you can go back to that work, nigga

I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
Nigga we're goin' home, home!
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen
You can kill me, I don't care—no!

Ayy, look, the basic thing is
You can do whatever you wanna do
Like I ain't 'bout to pass up on all this shit, you see this?
Like we time jumpin' and shit
You wanna go back and do what, just rap?
You can rap up here!
Yeah nigga, just rap
No, you can't, nigga, this is Space
You can't, fuck that, we goin' home

Reggae,Lupe Fiasco,2012,"Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album, Pt. 1",Form Follows Function,"I'mma just go... And then we'll figure it out from there
They say form follows function
And if you just function properly things will form themselves
Yeah, that's kind of what it is
So on that note... America's most

First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin' around my temple
Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
And they sink in the same sea that we walk
Not that we Jesus, we just don't wait until it thaws
But you can hold my hand like applause, pause
With no homophobia involved
Now if I would've said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls
That would've been the call, but naw
You can't see in ours, but we can see in yours
You can't see in ours cause ours is Kingdom Hall
Yeah, just like that, we just let it roll, you know?
Yeah, and check it, check it

So when that pond thaws and it's no longer Gretzky
That's when we jetski
I gotta catch up to myself, I kind of left me
Are the windows still blocked up? Let's see
Maybe see something we couldn't view before
Been in the stu all day cooking food for thought
Now out the soup du jour for you and yours
Might find sushi for your soul, we call that moving raw
Lions won't cross the line
Cougars won't move a paw
Chickens won't cross the road
Dogs won't roof at all
Always had flow, just added a front door, roof, and walls
Hotter than the fire that into which Koopa falls
But that's only if you super dawg
Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
You can never really tell just who's the fraud
Truth might still be alive like true and false
That's why I never really trust unless it's Lu endorsed
Sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced
Now that's three mis, like you warming up your vocal chords
Add a fourth if your vocals hoarse
Like Mister Ed
Get out of pocket have a horse's head in your bed
Now that's what I call a good night's rest
You know? You know, just plays like that
When you just let it flow
When you sit back and just let it go, you know?

And now my vocals warm
Add a fifth and a sixth now I'm ready to perform
The Buddhist said that I am not reformed
If I ever be reborn I keep coming back as me
Well don't forget the other five as we
Weave the most wanted Angelina Jolies
And Morgan Frees
Send it around the room like we smoking trees
But it's no purple in the circle then there ain't no rolling b's
Just spoken words, thought provoking reeds
Hydro, I'm still strolling on the seeds
Eye low, like the lotion from the leaves
And to achieve it took a lot of token like Chuck E. Cheese
All without touching weed
But I'm still hungry and I'm having lunch for three
This is my form, now what the function be
And art what I draw
And ooh, what I say like Imogen Heap
Good night niggas, go to sleep
You know? It's like form follows function
And if you function properly then
The form will come out of it
And whatever it is, it
It just be what it is, you know?"

The orchestra in my mind, don't play like this, naw
But I'm prepared for it, got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs, even cut my hair for it
Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be looking for light like that, then there go it
Yeah, right over there, so I prepared to pour it
Little scared, my stare lowered, momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already out of my chair
Gather up my Airs on my square from here forward
It's nothing, right
So here go it, whispered in her ear
It's kinda crowded in here would she care to blow it

You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight

Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor—it's hard to get
In the car we sit, from the intro
She rolled down the window, just in case I was a schizo
I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm, a little more confident
Uh huh, and then we lose consciousness
She says that I've been waiting for you
And I know you've been chasing me too, since they kidnapped
Me from a castle, I've been thinking of you
I told a fire-breathing dragon he better not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor, yes, you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said, ""See? Too beautiful to let you sleep
You're my sunshine""

You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight

Relationship is just thirty minutes long
It's kinda heavy, maybe a little strong
Gonna take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two, before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me: out of the trillions
Of numbers that's in the world just leave me a few
That lead to you
Won't be long then, I'll see you in the morning
Cool?

You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me

Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I’m not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I’m not keeping up
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

So, what are you going to stand for?
Dreads in the sky, I and I, 2 new Vans on a land four
Take that back, make that 2 new shoes on the van floor
Me and my band out on that road

While they touch less floors than a hand or
Ceiling fan or - wait, let me tell ya slower
Lift my fans up to the ceiling and you'll never touch the floor
Woah, now if Noah need a rower
I'll be there with my oar till we get back to the shore
Dad made me a soldier, GI Joe to these Cobras
Tryna FBI my Panther, CIA my Sankofa
Infiltrate my Carter, illuminate my culture
While they watching through that buckle, but I stay up on my hustle
Turn that belt back on they self, now I watch them scream for help
Like Africa need aid, or black women as maids
Uncover undercovers turn those maids to Bubba's mothers
Take the hero out the Nino, keep it real as trouble-trouble, huh?
Or maybe cartoon Martin on The Boondocks
Flip the script on chicks who think their shit smells like perfume shops
Help them girls find beauty without a magazine or movie
She Delilah with them .45s or Keisha with that Uzi
Now I know that's contradiction, wants and needs in competition
But it's hard to stay on point with such extremes in opposition
While we waiting on that compromise, proceed with that conscious eye
New gang alert: hashtag occupies

Only time I wrestle's when I'm wrestling with settling
Only way I settle if we wrestle over everything

Argue with your friends over what really the record means
Back and forth about its course, with professors refereeing
Why he so rebellious? Up-front with his realness?
They wanna be fiascoes, reproduce his failures
Emperor is his alias, but not Marcus Aurelius
This is more like Sparta: kick you down a well, kid
And on my last check, I copped the NSX, just like Pharrell did
Well did, better doings to come
My only promise is I'll never ruin the young
I'll never human the sung lyrics in a spirit that's
Superhuman to some, keep you pursuing the sum of
Slums, plus, get up out of them, plus, never forget

Cherubs and cerebellum
Tara at Sarah's wedding, Sam marrying Sam
Band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand (OOOH!)
If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't, well then you're wicked
Such is life, odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark grays, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals, vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And tell me of the spinning mothers
And today's mathematics for beloved
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers

How was your day?
Can I make what you say what I wanna hear?
Cause I want you here
The hell that we raised
To the heavens do anything for
La petite mort, la petite mort

They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like probably in the eye
What of the chicken? What is it missin'? Is it dry?
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed
And the tension from its demise
Pulled all of the flavor from the fat and made it flat
And rather lifeless, well there's a place
That has a stunning turbot and more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices
It's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices
My son will call risotto rices
If and when he's left to his own devices, well
How is your memory? Is it returning like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me?
Or was it slippin' like permission? Am I trippin' like field
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth
Maybe like kosher beef
Is it real? Is it real? Is it real? Ha, hah!

Howl at the day
Can I make you my prey?
Cause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear
The hell that we raised
To the heavens make symmetries for
Our petite mort, our petite mort

So glad you're back
But not glad at that you're glatt
Where is the glamour in collapse?
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds?
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The atelier slowly fills with baboons
And other monkey business
Where killers go free cause the junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter

How are your chains?
Do they make you behave?
Keep you over here, by your overseer
Fallen from grace
Down from Heaven to memories' floor
La petite mort, la petite mort"

Usually I stay, put em on the roof with more truth for me to say

A glacier in Jamaica or a penguin out in Palm Springs
Yeah, keep em in the air like a swan wing
And Imma keep it magic as a Harry Potter wand swing
And my little shop with my terracotta pot
You be talkin' bout your kush, you should come and hear my lawn sing
So put them up like a robbery
A Derrick Rose lob to me
And watch and see I alley-oop it properly
Football or volley-b, hock-el-y, or sock-el-y
You just get the rock to me
Try and put me down like Gaddafi over Lockerbie
I'll lock you in a locker b

You can't do that tomorrow

O ye tormented souls
My goal is to sit on the globe like North Poles
And thats the top mang, going hammer like a Glock can't
All flow and grammar, no shot drank
I'm so sober when I speak
I call it catching bullets with my teeth
You can feel it in your chest
Like Bruce Lee jumping on your vest
But I can't feel yours through my Superman 'S'
Yes, I'm Superman'd-out
Rare Cartier look like Superman house
Inshallah to my plan hope it super pans out
My life is like Italia doin 100 miles
And the top open like the roofer ran outta tiles
Walk right into Philippe's when I ran outta Chow's
Next up is crustaceans and fast food halals
The beef is all the same, its just how they kill the cows
Somebody tell Malcolm X that I'm tryna steal his style
And tell Cornel West that I'm tryna steal his fro
Go back in time, take the slaves plows, shovels, and the hoes
The masters get the ""It Was Written"" intro
SLR 10-4

Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you can't tell me what you gon do

Cause nigga, I don't believe that
Like 9/11 came from Iraq
Mayweather on the speedbag
Automatic weapons keep the same rhythm he has
That's how the hood sound
Grew up in the hood town
West side ghetto, Windy City Cook Count
Black skies lookin' up, crack pipes lookin' down
Accused of not lookin back, blind nigga look around
City on my back, so the CHI go errywhere I'm at
Presence so shiny, Mercedes so matte
Cop that from Platinum, the color of my plaque
I memorize ""Color's"" off of Yo! MTV Raps
A nightmare walking in a psychopath's nap
Defeat your purpose like a weed stash in the rehab
Guess who's sneaking in the weed bags
That be me with my me ass
Not tryna be anything but free as
Flow is so nuts, the track is gettin teabagged
Just wanna rap nice, that ain't me - tag
If you wanna be mean, then you wanna be me bad
Call it being Pretty Lyrically Swag
Soulja call it Super Lupe Lyrical
You can't understand me nor mimic my miracles
All I see is me and I'm a mother lovin' mirror-full
Bein' dope is all in the muscle
It's more than just a pause and a chuckle
I bench press elephants, and bowlin ball juggle
So don't be scared to take the Super Lu route
Top 5 alive and I only got 2 out!
School ya on your history, I tell ya what you 'bout
Fight for all the right things and let the Huey New out
Pharrell, what these niggas talkin' 'bout?
2 man Big Pun, a 1 man Slaughterhouse
A 2 album Jay-Z, a 1 nigga Wu-Tang
Young and hungry Mos Def, a conscious rappin Lil Wayne
I don't care for similarities

These ain't bars, this is barbarity

Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast

But you can't tell me what you gon do

Holy Shock and awing cattle prods
All up in the action with a fraction of the catalogue
Of my peers, I ain't doin' numbers like Anbesol
But I'm here, and I'm revered
Lyric boy, Based King, Master Chef, All City Chess moves Mickey Donny, Diggy, CRS fool
Carrera Era, Panamera, F-Tool, Emperor, Free Chilly nigga, FNF RULES!!!
'Ye, what these niggas talkin' 'bout?
A Jesus in the desert walking, Dundee walkabout
A self imposed exile, learn to let the awesome out
Even if I was homeless I would still have an awesome house
Cause the world is mine, Lupe to the rescue, the world is fine
Words and lines of mine, I feel. are better than every rap in the world combined!!
And that's how you do it
E'rything flow, errything fluid
Stupid with the raps, but the raps never stupid
Trakk on the music, SLR ruthless

Game over - body parts

From all your lungs and the lungs of your sons
Tell your daughters the water's a treasure
Summon the forest
Talkin' to trees, now how could you be in the chorus
With something so horrid?
You became boards for the floors and the doors of the warships

Made from itself and said, ""Burn us with that""

I'm the reason it's become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
(Let me put you on game)
They love my darkness, I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist

Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this, but they're fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow, I am the one that they march with

Through the back alleys and the black markets
The Oval offices, crack-houses, and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings

Through the veinses of the fiends
A paper chaser's pager, yo, I'm famous on the scene
One of the oldest, most ancientest things
Speak every single language on the planet, y'all mean?

The rape of Africa, the undying machine
The overpriced medicine, the murderous regime
The tough guy's front and the one behind the scenes

I'm its gym, and its math, and its history

I hope he's with your mother with my hustlers high in my traps

I hope you die in his trash
I can't help it, all I hear when you're crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
Behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had

Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper
A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs

I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader, the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel, so I make them cool

The parents are goners, no children to mourn us
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
We've lost all our babies, and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of the rhymer, the pimp and the riser
Your cross, there you'll find her

Disease, the virus is spreading in all directions
No safe zone no cure and no protection
No symptoms define the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies, and no corrections
Quarantine the dreams and seal off the connections
Don't let them in, not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and want you to have it next and
Don't accept them if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness, some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit and some say it's an entrance

The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war
Invented by the press, just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
Whores say the nuns, nuns say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientist say it only affects the mind
The little boy said it only affects the girls

A bum said it's going to kill the whole wide world

""Believe!"", so say the neon signs by the
Loudspeakers repeating that everything is fine;
A subtle solace to demolish the troubled conscience
Of a populace with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted
From the masters to the masses
From the antennas on the top of the shrines
Refine the receiver and plant it
During the panic and short it, it reports back
Everything in your mind, everything is lying
Everything is dying, everything is a rule
Everything is a crime, everything was here then
Everything rewind the new
Weather burned the feathers off everything flying
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit
The lavish, the fastest, the clashes, the ashes to ashes
Everything intertwined
My femme fatale my darling fraudulent angel
Once caught her changing the batteries in her halo
Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
Scientist said she's all inside my mind
The little boy said ""What happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said ""She's going to kill off your soul.""
The dope boy said ""It's the whole wide world.""

Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers

Reggae,Lupe Fiasco,2011,Lasers,Beautiful Lasers (2 Ways),"There's only 2 ways out of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here forever
There's only 2 ways out of here
One's through the door, the other's through me

Sometimes living in a world like this
It's pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't comply
Pretty easy if you don't complain
Stand there like you don't feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend til the end that you don't fear change
Don't admit that your faith is weak
Don't say that you feel like dying
Life's hard then it feels like diamonds
Your home's just far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Can't understand what I'm saying
Can't figure out what I'm implying
If you feel you don't wanna be alive
You feel just how I am
I'm on the dark side
And you can't come find him
How when it's light all around you
Yeah, But it's dark all inside him
No winners when it's me against me
One of us just ain't gonna survive
My heart been broke for a while
Your's been the one keepin' me alive

There's only 2 ways out of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here forever
There's only 2 ways out of here
One's through the door, the other's through me

This world is such a fucked up place
My mind's such a fucked up shape
Everything down here sucks
Maybe what's up there is great
We all gotta go one day
I just wanna cut to the chase
I wanna stop these nightmares
I just wanna touch your face
All you see is all my feats
All I see is all my flaws
All I hear is all my demons
Even through your applause
All you see is all my flights
Well all I see is all my falls
All you see is all my rights
All I see is all my wrongs
Door keep telling me to fight
Gun on my table telling me to come on
Telling me to to put him inside my hand
Then put it up right next to my dome
Door keep telling me to find a reason
Anything to keep me from squeezing
Simplest things, yea you really like summer
You really like music, you really like reading
Love! I can't win if it's me against me
One of us ain't gonna survive
And my heart been broke for a while
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
Yours been the one keepin' me alive

There's only 2 ways out of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here forever
There's only 2 ways out of here

Haka dance done at the welcome to the demo
Modern man comes to the weddin' in the limo
Mixin' doves with the rice rain
Uncle Ben's off the rails on the night train
And that storm took us to the platform, pushas
Back to the bachelor's backdoor, unhook us
Hope this track take you back to where the fat girl pushed us
And that's very old
Like Blackberry Bold but the juice
Sweeter than where the party at, or
Releasing these niggas from the roofs, and
Leavin' these niggas on the loose, or
Keepin' these niggas in the coops, and
Leavin' these niggas on the noose, free!

If I simple my search, will it mental my calm?
Will it hurt if I give you my palm?
To tell in it, don't put a nail in it
How you gonna see the world if you a whale in it
And readin' my palms like there's braille in it (braille in it)
Is it the trail or the forest? (forest)

Led to right decisions by his conscience

Reggae,N.W.A,1988,Straight Outta Compton,Fuck tha Police,"Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit ‘cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
‘Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit!
A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
(Gunshot sounds)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

(Knocking sounds)
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open out!
Aww, shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
(Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

The verdict:
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the fuck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!"
Reggae,N.W.A,1988,Straight Outta Compton,Straight Outta Compton,"You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)

Yo, Ren! (Whassup?)
Tell 'em where you from!

Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, ‘cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum, and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, ‘cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming…

Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton

Pull over to the side right now
Man, fuck them motherfuckers!

Yo, Dre! Give me a funky-ass bassline!
Right here!

Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me
Never should've been let out the penitentiary
Ice Cube would like to say
That I'm a crazy mothafucka from around the way
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Now I'm the mothafucka that you read about
Takin' a life or two, that's what the hell I do
You don't like how I'm livin'? Well, fuck you!
This is a gang and I'm in it
My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute
With a right left, right left, you toothless
And then you say: ""Goddamn, they ruthless!""
Everywhere we go they say: ""Damn!""
N.W.A's fuckin' up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don’t just say no, we’re too busy sayin', ""Yeah!""
About drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
Do I look like a mothafuckin' role model?
To a kid lookin' up to me
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me I’ll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta!
Hopin' you sophisticated motherfuckers
Hear what I have to say

When me and my posse stepped in the house
All the punk-ass niggas start breakin' out
'Cause you know, they know what’s up
So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep cryin'
""I got a boyfriend""—bitch, stop lyin'!
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nothin' but a dyke
Suddenly I see some niggas that I don't like
Walked over to 'em, and said, ""What's up?""
The first nigga that I saw, hit him in the jaw
Ren started stompin' him, and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said: ""Let's start some shit""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot
Takin' niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom, boom, boom! Yeah, I was gunnin'
And then you look, all you see is niggas runnin'
And fallin' and yellin' and pushin' and screamin'
And cussin', I stepped back and I kept bustin'
And then I realized it's time for me to go
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N.W.A is wanted for a homicide
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll tell you exactly how he feel
And don't hold a fuckin' thing back

Homies all standin' around, just hangin'
Some dope-dealin', some gang-bangin'
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin', I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car—are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin' at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit!
Man, what'cha gon' do now?
(What we're gonna do right here is go way back)
How far you goin' back? (Way back)
""As we go a lil' somethin' like this""—hit it!

Here's a little gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank, yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy-E cold runnin' shit

Well, I'm Eazy-E, the one they're talkin' about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
With the {diamond in the back, sun-roof top}
Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
'Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin' to you
""We want to fuck you, Eazy,"" I want to fuck you too
Because you see, I don’t really take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put a foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

He'll fuck up you and yours
And anything that gets in his way

It's not about a salary, it's all about reality

Reggae,N.W.A,1988,Straight Outta Compton,Express Yourself,"Dr. Dre: Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
Ice Cube: Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
Dr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself)

I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel

Express yourself
Come on and do it

Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...

Express yourself
Come on and do it

From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just

Well, suck this bitch!

Wait a minute -- who the fuck are you talking to?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
Man, I can't believe this shit -- this bitch is trying to gank me
I'll slap you up side your head with nine inches of limp dick!

You need a nigga with money so you get a dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She likes his car and he gets with her
Got a black eye cause the dopeman hit her
Let that slide and you pay it no mind
Find that he's slapping you all the time
But that's okay, cause he's so rich
And you ain't nothing but a dopeman's bitch!
Do what he say and you keep your mouth shut
Popping that trash might get you fucked up
You'll sit and cry if the dope man strikes you
He don't give a fuck - he got two just like you
There's a another girl in the dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch but far from a wife
Sh'es called the strawberry and everybody know
Strawberry, strawberry is the neighborhood ho
Do anything for a hit or two
Give tha bitch a rock, she'll fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the dopeman's dick
Strawberry just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around or she'll give you gonorrhea
And people out there are not hip to the fact
That Strawberry is a girl selling pussy for crack to the

Dopeman, dopeman!
Hey man give me a hit
Dopeman, dopeman!
Hey yo man fuck that shit
Dopeman, dopeman!
In yo face
Yo Dre, kick in tha bass

If you smoke 'caine, you're a stupid motherfucker
Known around the hood as the schoolyard clucker
Doing that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searching for a piece of rock
Jonesing for a hit and you're looking for more
Done stole a Alpine of out Eazy's 6-4
You need your ass whooped cause it's out of this earth
Can't get a 10 piece need a dolla fifty's worth
Knucklehead nigga, yeah, you turned into a crook
But swear up and down, boy, that you ain't hooked
You beat your friend up and you whooped his ass long
Cause he hit the pipe till the rock was all gone
You're robbing and stealing, bugging and illing
While the dope man's dealing
What is killing your pain, cocaine, this shit's insane
Yo, E, she's a berry, let's run a train

Man, I wouldn't touch that bitch

Me neither; Ho, go home and wash out your beaver
And niggas out there messing up people's health
Yo, what the fuck yo gotta say for yourself?

Well, I'm the dopeman - yeah, boy, wear corduroy
Money up to here but unemployed
You keep smoking that rock and my pocket's getting bigger

Yo, got that five-0 - double up, nigga

Yeah, high rolling, big money I'm folding
Bitch on my tip for the dick I'm holding
Strung strawberry jocking me so early
Ho, you want a hit you gotta get your knees dirty
Well, that's my life that how it's cut

Hey, dopeman!

Bitch, shut the fuck up
Gotta make a run, it's a big money deal

But if she happens to die because of your drug
I'm putting in your culo a .38 slug!"
Reggae,N.W.A,1989,N.W.A. and the Posse,A Bitch Iz a Bitch,"Let's describe a certain female
A female with a disease of character and attitude
If you will a snob
However in the view of NWA...

A bitch is a bitch
So if I'm poor or rich
I talk in the exact same pitch
Now the title bitch don't apply to all women
But all women have a little bitch in 'em
It's like a disease that plagues their character
Taking the women of America
And it starts with the letter B
It makes a girl like that think she better than me (bitch)
See, some get mad and some just bear it
But, yo, if the shoe fits wear it
It makes 'em go deaf in the ear that's why
When you say 'hi' she won't say 'hi'
Are you the kind that think you're too damn fly?
Bitch eat shit and die
Ice Cube coming at you at a crazy pitch
(Why?) I think a bitch is a bitch

Who the fuck you think you calling a bitch you little sorry motherfucker
I don't know who the fuck you think you talking to
Let me tell you one motherfucking thing, I'm not no-
""Bitch, shut the fuck up""

Yo, you can tell a girl that's out for the money
She look good and the bitch walk funny
She ain't no dummy, she's rather conniving
Yo bitch, fuck what I'm driving
See a young nigga that's striving
You're through without a BMW
That's why a bitch is a bitch I guess
Or either P-M-S
Here, test the girl that's kinda snobby
And I bet you dissing niggas is her hobby
And after she finished the test
Grade today of B-I-T-C-H
And watch her get mad 'cause she know it's true (she know it)
But a nigga like me'll say ""fuck you""
Do like Ice Cube, slam her ass in a ditch (word) (slam her ass)
'Cause a bitch is a bitch

""Why I gotta be a bitch?""
I ain't call you no bitch, if you listen to the goddamn song it'd tell you what a bitch is...
""Fuck the song 'cause I'm not no motherfucking bitch""
I didn't say you was a bitch, if you stop acting like a goddamn bitch
""Fuck you, little punk-ass little nigga""
Fuck you, bitch! You sloppy-ass, scandalous-ass ho!
""Fuck you! Who the fuck you think you are?""
Fuck you! Suck my dick, bitch! You scandalous-ass, doo-doo dog breath, stinking, ugly...

I once knew a bitch who got slapped
'Cause she played me like she was all that
A bitch can be your best friend talking behind your back (yeah?)
About who's fucking who and who's getting fat
Look at yourself for me (look, bitch)
Now do you fall in this category?
Or you the kind that won't blink
'Cause you don't think your shit stink
Lucky I haven't had a drink
'Cause I'd down your ass
Then I'd clown your ass
'Cause the niggas I hang with ain't rich
We'll all say ""Fuck you bitch!"" (word)
Now what can I do with a ho like you
Bend your ass over and then I'm through (get the fuck out)
'Cause you see Ice Cube ain't taking no shit
(Why?) 'Cause I think a bitch is a bitch

There you have it, the description of a bitch
Now ask yourself are they talking about you?
Are you that funky, dirty, money-hungry, scandalous, stuck-up, hair piece contact wearing bitch?
Yep, you probably are
Bitch!"

Reggae,N.W.A,1990,100 Miles and Runnin’,Real Niggaz,"Yo, what’s up niggas and niggettes?
N.W.A is back in this motherfucker
And this is only the single
Wait until the motherfucking album comes out
We gone have some more of that good shit
The shit you just can’t fuck with
But yo, we ain’t finished, tell ‘em what’s up man
Yo man, there’s a gang of motherfuckers out there on the dick, man
In every motherfuckin' state
Wanna be like, wanna look like, wanna act like
Wanna dress like, wanna sound like muthafuckin' style stealin'
Clone ass N.W.A bitin' ass motherfuckin' everywhere man
Non-reality seein', non-reality feelin'
Non-reality livin' ass motherfuckers man
Hey, I don’t know, reality, it’s important to me, man
So fellas man, tell these niggas what it’s like in the minds of real niggas

Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you's a sucker
And you ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Don’t try to hang, you best avoid
Cause my foot will be so far up your ass you’ll get hemorrhoids
Before you try to fuck wit Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10

First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac
Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
Now how the fuck you think a rap will last?
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy

Falling deep in the drums so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and now beating, the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us

Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you
You can't harm me, alarm me
Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know
We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo
Try us and take it
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in

It's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas

You can run, but you can’t hide, you know I'mma find'cha
Cause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind'cha
Don’t look back because you’re shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on
Don't step on my muthafucking stage without nike's on
Don’t say it’s psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow

All these niggas wit the jibber jabber
But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because, yo, it’s the shit that we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But I'mma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead

Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see
A little streetwise nigga, you know me
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get?
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees
Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real

Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught
So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats

They played out, that's what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we ain't happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit
Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record comes, I’ll come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb
You're on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up
Cause if I let you slide, it’s just cause you lucked up
Don’t come in my face again, because I'mma floor ya
And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitude's a little bigga
Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas

Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad there's
Sucka muthafuckas like you, making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that’s smart
A nigga that’s paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, N.W.A, criticize for what we say
But I'm a do the shit anyway
Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking
Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in

N.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990's
Yo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E
And I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'all"
Reggae,N.W.A,1991,Efil4zaggin,Appetite for Destruction,"I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the ""Drop!""
'Cause her son caught the slug
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I rhyme to the rhythm of a pop
Remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack de fact
And take that shit back
'Cause they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit
Murder in the first degree and manslaughter
Takin' the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches that look sucked up
And the niggas is killin', it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin' what I'm sayin is for greed
Then I ain't even what they're tryin' to feed
My appetite for destruction
""You guys know who I'm talkin' to""

The appetite is tremendous, so I'm gonna spin this
Drop up some violence because they ask me to end this
Some trouble that I cought 'cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze
He took a swing for my head, thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went bang
And all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain
'Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, 'cause I hit like a mothafuckin' bomb
I do damage with the 9 in my hand
But the average nigga that don’t know me don’t understand
I'm from the streets, so therefore
You know I don't care for a sucker that ain't down
With the real niggas, the niggas, the niggas
Yo, and after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war 'cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
And that's the million and one, they couldn't hang with the appetite, 'cause they wasn't rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up the essence – appetite for destruction

""Cops put a hurtin' on yo' ass, man
You know, they really degrade you
White folks don't believe that shit
They don't believe that cops degrade you
 Oh come on, those people, those people are resisting arrest.""

Check it out, y'all, in the house, y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road
To Compton, but first let me tell you somethin'
I possess the 10 commandments of the hip-hop thugsta
Known as the thief and murderer
First one – honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect or break your mothafuckin' neck
Second one – always gotta fuck out of wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snap, crackle and pop
Number three – I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any fools tryna 'cause some static
Number four – here's what's in store
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hardcore
Fifth one – my kill has just begun
I pull out my gun, that'll keep me on the run
Step six – hmmm, it's kinda tricky
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chicken-shit
To the ones who tries to play the E
By the time you get to seven, you'll be six feet deep
Number eight – make no mistake
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey
Ninth one – I gotta be raw
Fuck any brainwashin' man-made law!
Last but not least, I must be real
Number ten – is my appetite to ki–"

We haven't spotted them yet. But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity

A 100 miles and runnin' -  MC Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck
Chances are usually not good
'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who
When in a black and white the capacity is two
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers
Not wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past
Point blank, they can kiss my black ass
I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck Tha Police""
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace
Now it's broken and can't be fixed
'Cause police and little black niggas don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall

FBI sources tell us that the four are headed
100 miles to their home base, Compton

So I can tell you why

Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase
With a steady pace on the face that just reads race
The road ahead goes on and on
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon
Runnin' on but never runnin' out
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do

Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!
And any mutherfucker that disagrees
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass
'Cause I been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick
Now the FBI's all over my dick

Got the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block
A 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch
Yeah, back to Compton again
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind

Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide
Good luck brothers

Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused
I know it was a set-up - So now I'm gonna get up
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong
They got everybody singin' my ""Fuck Tha Police"" song
And while they treat my group like dirt
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts
So I'mma run 'til I can't run no more
'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score
I got a urge to kick down doors
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls

Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'

So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it
The number's even - now I'm leavin'
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in
Her and the troops are right behind me
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me

One more mile to go through the dark streets
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet
But you know I never stumble or lag last
I'm almost home so I better haul ass
Tearin' up everything in sight

Reggae,N.W.A,1988,Straight Outta Compton,I Ain’t tha 1,"Ice Cube, do you think you could give me some money to get my hair done?
What's wrong with your hair right now?
Well you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails done too
Look, I'mma tell you like this

I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin up in em
But you know, I'm a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to 'em, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See, they think we narrow minded
'Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say ""How ya doin'?""
See, I'm only down for screwin', but you know
Ya gotta play it off cool
'Cause if they catch you slipping, you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know you're getting their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show em off
But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give
And no take
Run out of money, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
'Cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it
Messing with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Ice Cube, girl, 'cause I ain't the one

Girrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money you can honey. 'Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't do nothin' for me but get out of my face
I know what you mean, girl; it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off unless he got dollars!

Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
He's getting juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nuttin' of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say
I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A
'Cause I'm gamin' on a female that's gamin' on me
You know I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no
Flowers to your doorstep, when we goin out
'Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt
And after the date, I'mma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster, huh? I'm thinking Burger King
And when I take you, you get frustrated
You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin' out the pocket, to knock it
But when the damage is done
You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one

I don't care how they look; if they got money, we can hook up but they ain't gettin' none
Yeah, I just make em think they gonna get some, play with they mind a lil bit, and get that money. Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?

Give you money? Why bother?
'Cause you know I'm looking nothing like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
'Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself, homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave 'em and love and stay above 'em
I used to get no play; now she stay behind me
'Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some; now she feels dumb
To my homies it's funny
But that's what you get trying to play me for my money
Now don't you feel used?
But I don't give a hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it?
'Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I don't burn
You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one

But you said you love me!
I don't see no rings on this finger
Why you doin' me like this? I love you!
Yeah, you love my money; I got what I wanted -- beat it!"
Reggae,N.W.A,1988,Straight Outta Compton,If It Ain’t Ruff,"Ain't that kinda shit you can sweep under no rug, you know?

Ren is the villain and you're just an hostage
So whenever I'm steppin' cover your head like an ostrich
Groupies been waitin' for this, suckers been hatin for this
You know why? Because so many are relatin' to this
Jealous is how they feel it intentionally
But they start to love it because I made it eventually
Pumpin' the music I keep the music like pumpin'
Cause Ren ain't in here for nothin', I keep the average crowd jumpin'
Yo, you know the color, the villain's in black
Always down to make noise, and attack
So you better get back unless you wanna come with it
And make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it
You're screamin' with fear but it's with fear that you're screamin'
You're wakin up in a sweat cause Ren is givin' bad dreams and
I'm not schemin', I'm just tellin the facts
That's how it is when N.W.A. starts to jack
So brothers that wanna scrap with me
That sweezin' and sneezin' will have to lap with me
Especially beggin' to write some lyrics with me
I just snatch your girl to take a nap with me
Cause when it comes to Ren there's no comparison
And if you try to be me, it's quite embarrassin'
But I understand cause you're mentally slow
Cause I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go

If it ain't ruff, it ain't me
The gangsta's black and he's about to attack
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me
Lemme bust a freestyle there - (Alright bet)

I can tell that you're afraid to fight me
Simple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me
Because your sweat is a puddle but there's a puddle o' sweat
I'm a threat, so get a cold rag and wipe your neck
And clean the dirt off your face that causes acne
It's ridiculous thinkin' that you can jack me
This is the round where the punch will go
Into your H-E-A-D; that's known as a blow
I'm makin a point but it's a point that I'm makin
Like, see, I'm hatin' the fakin' I keep the suckers like shakin'
Scared to speak with a thought when they're chosen
The sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen
This is a battle to the death, it's like the same ol'
Against a brother on a tip, with a Kangol
Givin' a pain but it's with pain that I'm givin
But I'm comparin' and tearin' em but I'm makin a livin'
With the hype of a nine volt battery
And the odds for me to conquer is averagely good
Meanin' I'mma flow
I'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go

If it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)
The gangsta's black and he's about to attack
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me
Man whatcha gonna do now? - *Get funky*

The 'do not disturb' sign is in effect
While I'm thinkin of a fool to select
To give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim
Slammin' my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them
Tell 'em they're guilty, and peep out the bailer
And get a new track o' drums so I can play with
Percussion, pumpin' it loud when I perform
Yo, you wanna play in my game, put on a uniform
It ain't a rule in the book you have to go by
Hey, cause when it comes to cheatin', yo, you should know I
For fear in the hearts cause it's the hearts full of fear
Coz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear
The Hulk was incredible yo but Ren he was super
But now I'm ruthless, a civilian and not a trooper
But a soldier with a top rankin
Givin' dope material, the hell with the gankin'
So play like an airplane and just jet
And keep your blood pressure low cause I'm a threat, if not
I'm afraid of the show
That you're a sucker and you're too nervous to go

If it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)
The gangsta's black and he's about to attack
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)
The gangsta's black
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me
The gangsta's black and he's about to attack
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)
The gangsta's black
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me
The gangsta's black and he's about to attack
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)
The gangsta's black
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me"
Reggae,N.W.A,1991,Efil4zaggin,She Swallowed It,"Lesson 2 : Gently place the balls into the mouth and
Hmmmmmmmmm..

Get it all baby
Get it all baby
Get it all baby
(What you want me to do with it?)
Don't matter just don't bite it
(""She swallowed it"")
Suck this dick for daddy
(""She swallowed it"")
Juicin' at the lips
(""She swallowed it"")
It's the world's biggest dick
(What do you want me to do with it?)
Don't matter just don't bite it

Slow is the tempo - now talkin' but a nympho
So peep it out here goes the info
This is a bitch that did the whole crew
She get it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through
And for the shit that she does, give her a drum roll
Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
And she'll let you videotape her
And if you got a gang of niggas, the bitch would let you rape her
She likes suckin' on dicks, and lickin' up nut
And they even take the broomstick up the butt
Just to say that she did it with a rapper
But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
""But how many licks would it take,"" she asks
""To make MC Ren start gooshin' up vanilla shakes?""
She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top
Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistable
I couldn't pay the bitch to quit
Cuz the ho' was doin' some ol' crazy shit
That made me start havin' a fit'
Cuz the bitch sucked a hellified dick 


Now one night I was at a drive-in
And a car full of niggas straight drove in
I thought they wuz commin' to start trouble but no
Five niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho'
Now what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy
Thirty minutes later and the windowz all were foggy
And I'm off in my car havin' a fit cuz the bitch that I'm with
Said no fuckin' on the first date, shit
And I'm like Damn! I wish I was in the bucket
To be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it
So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar
And got the fuck out the car
Went to the bucket and I looked through the window
It was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo
And my turn was like next
I couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest
I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughtta
Peep over the seat, Oh shit! It's the preacher's daughter!
And she's only 14 and a ho'
But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro
She looked at me, I was surprised
But wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized
I told the bitch to do it quick
You little ho' hurry up and suck my dick!


Now I'm a break it down with a fact
Since the last ""Just don't bite it"" girls don't know how to act
Sayin' that they never would suck a dick
But when they've tried it they couldn't quit
Cuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit
And those are the main ones that say they don't do it
But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it
So fellas, next time they try to tell a lie
That they never suck a dick, punch a bitch in the eye
And then the ho' will fall to the ground
Then you'll open up her mouth
Put your dick in and move the shit around
And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own
Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone
And then she won't let go
Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano
Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe
Then the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night
Because she just can't quit
Cuz she's addicted, addicted, she's addicted, addicted
She's addicted to suck a good dick"
Reggae,N.W.A,1987,N.W.A. and the Posse,8 Ball,"(Kick that shit)
(Cold kicking ass)
Cold kicking ass
Cold kicking ass
(Funky fresh Eazy-E)
(Pull up a chair and I'mma tear shit up)

I don't drink brass monkey, like the beat funky
Nickname Eazy-E, yo' 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kicking to show my shit
Rapper holdin' my dick, boy, I don't quit
And if ain't rap, then you know it's crap
Crowd rocking sucka stomper from around the way
I got a six-shooter, yo, mean I'm brave
E rolling out, to find the Boyz
To kick dust and cuss, crank up some noise
Police on my tail, I d'ont like jail
40 ounce in my lap and and it's cold as hell
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself, they can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the eight in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the Eastside, South of Compton
See a big ass, and I say word
I took a look at her face, and the bitch was to the curb
But she was on my tip for the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's getting busy got the 8-ball rolling

I, was...cold kicking ass
I, was...raised in L.A
I, was...cruising down the street in my six-four
Too much posse

Riding on Slausson, looking for Crenshaw
Turned down the sound, to ditch the law
Stopped at a light and  had a fit
Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tip cause I was drunk
See a sissy ass punk, had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause it's like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Pulled out the jammy and like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of Dodge
Sucka on me cause the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 Ball rolling
Fuck it up, y'all
Fuck it up, y'all
Fuck it up, y'all
Fuck it up, y'all
Fuck it up, y'all
Fuck it up, y'all
Yeah

Olde English 800, because that's my brand
Take it in a bottle, forty, quart or can
Drink it like a madman, yes I do
Fuck the police and a 502
Stepped in the party, I was drunk as hell
Three bitches already said, "" Eric yo' breath smells! ""
40 ounce in hand that's what I got
Yo man you see Eazy hurlin in the parkin lot
Stepped on your foot cold dissed your hoe
Asked her to dance and she said, hell no
Called her a bitch because that's the rule
Boyz-n-the hood trying to keep me cool
Tell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get em up
I started dropping the dogs, and watch you fold
Just dumb full of cum got knocked out cold
""Make you look sick you snotty nosed prick!
Now your fly bitches all over his dick!""
Punk got dropped cause the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling

Pass the brew Ren while I tear shit up
And y'all listen up close to roll call
Eazy-E's in the place I got money and juice
Rendezvous with me and we make the deuce
Dre makes the beats so funk funk funky
Do the Olde 8, forget the brass monkey
Ice Cube writes the rhymes, that I say
Hail to the niggas from C.I.A
Krazy D is down and in effect
We make hardcore jams, so fuck respect
Make a toast all you punk to the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's breaking out and got the 8-ball rolling
Man I'm outta here
Yo Eazy, you forgot to tell em what city you chill in
In the city (city of Compton)
In the city (city of Compton)
City City City of Compton
City City City of Compton
City City City of Compton
City City City of Compton
City City City of Compton"
Reggae,N.W.A,1988,Straight Outta Compton,Parental Discretion Iz Advised,"One, two, three, kick it

Aiyyo Dre, what's goin' on man? What's goin' on?
Ay what ch'all gonna do for this last record?
Nah tell me what cha'all gonna do?
Okay, you want me to do the intro? Aight!

Parental discretion is advised for the moment
While I'm getting candid, now understand it
Ain't too typical in any way, though the pro
On the mic is the D.O. to the C., this is an intro
I know The D.O.C. makes you want to take a Valium
So buy a bucket cause upcoming is my album
And for the record, meaning my record, check it
Listen to the single and you'll be like, yo, I gotta get it
But in the meantime, listen to the rhyme
Of the Dr. Dre played with N.W.A
Yella's on the drum roll, rocking the beat
Aiyyo Dre, where's you gonna take this shit man?

Aiyyo, let's take it to the street (WORD UP!)
Let 'em understand perfection
Let knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessing
Cause I don't give a fuck about radio play
Observe the English I display
Lyrics for the adults, children have been barred
And scarred from listening to something so motherfucking hard
Dope, pumping that's so my shit will never falter
Yo it's Dre so fuck the ""Mind of Minolta""
Psycho like no other motherfucker
So step to me wrong, G-O for what you N-O
But be warned, never will I leave like a regular
Cause I'm a little better than the regular competitor
I use to see 'em on stage
Earning money like a thief, but without a gauge
Until I got full, of clocking the lame getting pull
(They said you wasn't gon' get paid)
Nah that's bullshit! They like it stylistic
And I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic
(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashing when I'm in action
A photo, or fresh with a flair for fashion
Pure simplicity -- see, it's elementary
You hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century
Try to comprise a word to the wise and the guys
Parental discretion is advised

Ren is most extremely high performance
The black hat cause I worn this, cause it's like enormous
Some shit I don't take it, not even in a toilet
And shit from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe the motherfuckers will learn
I'm not a sub, cause I speak sensible
Not considered a prince, cause I'm a principal
I'm engineering the shit that you're hearing
Cause when it comes to power, I'm power steering
Silly you say, I say you're silly when you say it
Rushing to the eject, to put my shit in and play it
It's like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur
And I'm not giving a fuck while I'm damaging ya
It's for the record; so Ren's lyrics is gonna spin it
And if there was a trophy involved, I'd win it
Possession is mine and I'm the holder
Cause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck cause I'm older
So for you to step off would be wise
And say fuck it, parental discretion is advised

I be what is known as a bandit
You gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
Cause if you fail to see, read it in Braille
It'll still be funky -- so what's next is the flex
Of a genius, my rapid-stutter-stepping if you seen this
Dope, you hope that I don't really mean this
But if Play made a greater high-top fade
It's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark
You guess it was a test of a different style
It's just another motherfucker on the pile
Driving your ass with the flow of the tongue
You hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung
To your attention, by the hardest motherfucking artist
That is known for lynching any sucker in a minute
Stagger 'em all
When I start flowing like Niagara Falls
Ice Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
Move like a snake when I'm mad; and then my tail rattle
I get low on the flow so let your kids know
When I bust, parental discretion is a must

Little did they know that I would be arriving
And it's surprising, rocking it from where I been
But it's the E here to take, no mistake to be made
In the trade where funky ass records are being played
Fuck the regular, yo as I get better the
Bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick
So I get 'em hot, thinking they're gonna get it
As they sit, rubbing their legs like a cricket
To you it may be funny, but
There's no service of beef without money
So slip the C-note, and you can choke
On a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat
Foreplay to me ain't shit
When you spread 'em I'm ready, then you can get the dick
Of the Eaz, if you can deal with the size
But if you can't, parental discretion's advised!

Shut the fuck up!"
Reggae,N.W.A,1988,Straight Outta Compton (Clean),Straight Outta Compton (Clean),"You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

Straight outta Compton, it's a crazy brotha named Ice Cube
From the stupid-dope gang wit a attitude
When I'm called off, I gotta sawed-off
Kick knowledge and bodies are hauled off
You too boy if you get with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off yo back, that's how I'm going out
For the sucka dumb brothas that's showing out
Some start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Going off on everybody like that
With bass that's droppin' in your face
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep you dancing
With a crime record like Charles Manson
Yo Dre, what's the sound of my tool?
Now you know that I'm about to act a fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking suckas out the box, daily
Yo weekly, monthly and yearly
Until the whole damn world see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't step to me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck down
Cause Ice Cube will damn sure buck 'em down
As I leave, believe I'm stomping
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton

Yo Ren

Whassup

Tell em where you from

Straight outta Compton, a brotha with his finger on the trigger
More punks I take out, my rep gets bigger
I'm a ruthless villain and you know this
But the suckas in the public won't show this
But I don't really care, I'mma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking the craps
It's like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when illegally armed it's called packing
Knock a fool out in a sec
I find somebody talkin' trash and put em in check
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'mma call you a sucka if you don't go with the flow
You'll probably get mad like a punk is supposed to
But that shows me, yo, you're composed to
A crazy young brotha from the street
Attitude legit cause I'm ready to hit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any fool in my way that starts static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, cause people know me as a villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killing
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, you know you're through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a brotha like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton

Eazy is his name and the boy is coming

Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous young brotha raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See I don't really care, that's the problem
When I see a police, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see the punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing suckas driving
But don't know where the hell they going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless
Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see I'll get over the hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and now I'm jetting
And leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the girl who got shot 
You think I give a damn about a girl, I ain't a sucker
This is the autobiography of the E
And if you ever mess with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the mother, yeah!
Straight outta Compton

That's the way it goes in the city of Compton, boy"
Reggae,N.W.A,1991,Efil4zaggin,Niggaz 4 Life,"Why you brothers insist on usin' the word nigga?
Don't you know that's bringin' down the black race?
Nigga nigga nigga that's all I hear you motherfuckers talk about is nigga
You can do what you want, just keep it out of my neighborhood
Personally I think the lyrics are a bit too harsh
I ain't no nigga, fuck that shit
Does everything come out your mouth got to be a 4-letter word?
All over this bullshit, it's just a bunch of fuckin' noise
The way you talk about women is bullshit, plain bullshit
What you motherfuckers doin' for the black community anyway?
Motherfucker I got kids, I don't want 'em listenin' to that bullshit
{*hospital monitor starts beeping*}
Fuck the niggas!
Motherfuckers need to stop
How can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it?
{*monitor stops beeping - R.I.P.*}
 Flatline
 Bullshit!

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Well it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me
And run me outta my neighborhood
And label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good
But I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out
Gave em some dope and a corner so they could show out
When the cops came, they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore, to make more
A 15-year-old black kid'll go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
I guess it's just the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin' a job was murder
Fuck flippin' burgers, cause I deserve a
Nine-to-five I can be proud of, that I can speak loud of
And to help a nigga get out of
Yo! The concrete playground
But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But I'm a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin' paid like a motherfucker
A young brother, who don't give a fuck about another
Yeah

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that I'm rollin
They swear up and down that the car was stolen
Make me get face down in the street
And throw the shit out my car on the concrete
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because my mouth is so motherfuckin' nasty
Bitch this, bitch that, nigga this, nigga that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin' fat
Gettin' paid to say this shit here
Makin' more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
So why not call myself a nigga?
It's better than pullin' the trigger and goin' up the river
And then I get called a nigga anyway
Broke as a motherfucker and locked away, so
So cut out all that bullshit
Yo! I guess I'll be a nigga for life
(""Niggas, crackers, jews!""
""If there's hell below, we're all gonna go!"")

Nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga, please
I'm treated like a fuckin' disease
You say - why do I call myself a nigga so quick?
Cause I can reach in my drawers and pull out a bigger dick, yo
Nigga say nigga we cool but
Cracker say nigga, nigga knocked the fuck up
But I gotta be a fast nigga, to never be the last nigga
Or I'll have to beat yo' ass, nigga
In the city you see action first
Then hear about it later in a verse I curse
Because I'm real with this to keep my shit straight bumpin
Murder, created by the streets of Compton
Now get it from the underground poet
I live it, I see it, and I write it because I know it
And if you think I'm fuckin' your wife
You're motherfuckin' right yo, cause I'm a nigga for life

I love niggas, I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love that you niggas (""niggas for life"")

Nigga this, nigga that
The actual fact is that I'm black and bound to attract
The attention of another, I mean the other
But I'm a motherfucker that'll have 'em runnin' for cover
You see, I don't give a fuck about nothin'
Except gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches
Which is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay
But what about the fake niggas, the house niggas
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But N.W.A. is outta your motherfuckin' range
We ain't gonna change a motherfuckin' thang!

I call myself a nigga cause my skin won't lighten
I call myself a nigga cause the shit that I'm writin
Hypes me, hypes other motherfuckers around me
And that's the reason why they wanna surround me
And ask me - why do I call myself a negro?
Ain't none of their fuckin' business cause I'll let the trigger go
So get out my presence and get out of my sight
Cause MC Ren is a nigga for life

You're a nigga 'til you die
If you're a po' nigga, you're a po' nigga
If you're a rich nigga, you're a rich nigga
But you never stop bein' a nigga
And if you get to be educated you just an educated nigga
(""I can dig it!"")

It's plain to see, you can't change me
Cause I'mma be a nigga for life
{*static noise*}

I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggas
Wouldn't you like to be a nigga too?"
Reggae,N.W.A,1988,Straight Outta Compton,Express Yourself (Extended Mix),"Dr. Dre: Yo man there's alot of brothers out there flakin and perpatratin who scared to kick reality
Ice Cube: Yo Dre you've been doin all this dope producin', you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
Dr. Dre: So watch do you want me to do

All you got to do now, express yourself

I'm expressin' with my full capabilities
Now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
'Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate, like a Buddhist
I'm droppin' flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and it'll make ya think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
'Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what, I won't hesitate to dis one or two before I'm through
So don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm droppin' English
Even if Yella, makes it a-capella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
'Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothin'
But makin' a sucker and you equal
Don't be another sequel

Express yourself
Do it good
Express yourself
Oh do it

Ice Cube, is not for the pop charts
So where should a brother like you start expressin' yourself
My boy'll show you how
Yo Dre  - What up? - Drop English right about...
....Now, gettin' back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back - New jacks are made hollow
Expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow the words
The style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again
Yo ya on the other end
Watch a brother playin' dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessin' and guessin' while I'm expressin myself
It's crazy to see people be what society wants 'em to be
But not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
And those musicians, curse at home
But scared to use profanity, when up on the microphone
Yeah they want reality, but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show they go lookin for the dope man
Oh they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A. and say ''Hell no!''
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to
(express yourself)

Express yourself
Do it do...
Express yourself
Oh do it!

A lyricist, yo Dre is the name for it
To make somethin' dope on a record that's what he came for
Kickin' reality yo but staying hisself
But it's important to keep it in mind to (Express yourself)
From the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then
Expression is big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift
Movin' like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of them expression
And if you start fessin', I got a Smith&Wesson for ya
I might ignore your record, because it has no bottom
I get loose in the Summer, Winter, Spring and Autumn
It's Dre on the mic gettin physical
Doin' the job, NWA is the lynch mob
Yes I'm macabre, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin' just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here's the rumour, Dre's in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressin myself, Yella slam it
'Cause if I stay funky like this, I'm doin' damage
Or I'mma be too hyped, I need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we gettin' hype tonight
'Cause if I strike, It ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just
(express yourself)

Express Yourself
Do it good...
Express Yourself
Oh do it"

Ready to fuck until my dick is raw
Yo! the muthafuckin' devil's son-in-law

No it's the E, the mothafuckin' pussy-beater
And I’m the quicker-picker-up, I'm quick to pick up a bitch
So come here bitch and lick up and lick up and lick up the dick
Now how many nuts would it take for me
To let that bitch graduate to lesson three, let's see
(Splash splash splash splash splash splash)
As you can see I straight waxed that ass
Back up bitch unless you want nut in your eye
I never never ever ever seen a bitch cry
Nut one, nut two, nut four, five, six
I lost the third nut in the mix, fuck it!
(Hey yo Yella boy, why don't you rewind it!)
Six, five, four, now three is up
Gimme that gimme that gimme that nut
You wanna feel the dick baby try your luck
Because the E likes to fuck fuck fuck yo
I get 'em stuck-on and get the fuck on
Give 'em a Tootsie Roll and tell 'em thanks for the pussy hole
I find 'em fuck 'em and flee you know
But before I D.O. - yo I take a ho to the hotel
To the motel, to the holiday inn
Yo, if that bitch start fuckin' up (What you do?)

Yo the beat don't stoppin' 'till the break o' dawn
Yo, every bitch I know they wanna get with me
The motherfuckin' notorious D-R-E
Spit game at a bitch while a nigga's around
And you know most ho's knows not to clown
Cause if a bitch tries to diss me while I'm full of liquor
I smack the bitch up and shoot the nigga that's with her
That's the kind of nigga that you're listenin' to
Talk to you for a minute then my dick's in you
Yo now every single bitch got a price to pay
Up on the dicks of N.W.A
I find 'em fuck 'em and flee you know
But before I D.O. - yo, I take a hoe to the hotel
To the motel, to the holiday inn (say what?)
If that bitch start fuckin' up, yo
I'll just fuck her friend

Now MC Ren
What up?
My mellow
A check it out
It's on you - so what the fuck you're gonna do?

Now gather around y'all, and check it out y'all
And all the bitches come and suck up on my balls y'all
And take a ticket to play with it like a Slinky
So put your lips on my big chocolate twinkie
And you swallow all the nut if you bitches are smart
To make my dick pop up like a Pop-Tart
But after I nut I'mma leave ya
But first I must deceive ya, because bitch I don't need ya
And don't say that you love me too
Cause if I turn my back you would fuck the whole crew
You're nothin' but a stank ho' tryin' to take my bank ho'
So I have to let you know  at a hotel
And a motel and a holiday inn (say what?)
Because if that bitch starts fuckin' up yo
I'll just fuck her friend"

Reggae,N.W.A,1990,100 Miles and Runnin’,Just Don’t Bite It,"God damn, now lick my balls, oh shit
 You like that?
Put 'em off
 It's good?
Ouch, shit, godamn bitch you bit' my damn
Shit I said suck the mothafucka, you're bitin' it, shit!

Has this ever happened to you?
Does her teeth get in the way while she's sucking your dick?
Does she know how to suck a dick?
Well, I had that same problem until my bitch went out and bought N.W.A's new book entitled ""The Art of Sucking Dick""

Lesson 1 - First you grab the dick
Next you gently lick it up and down, then insert it into the mouth
Take it slow, don't rush it, and before you know it ..
SPLASH!

It goes one for the treble, two for the bass
She got nut all over her face
Kick kick it ...

Slow is the tempo, and Ren is gonna flow
As I produce and illustrate you to a ho
Caught on the late night, stamping on the base-pipe
She's a hype to get you on the late flight
But back in school she was a cutie, yo
Then after graduation started giving up the booty
In school, stuck her head in a feather
Every time I asked her what's the time
It was never ever what she would talk to the Ren I'm sayin'
I wanted a date, she wouldn't even be my friend
But now in the 1990's, I'd be praying that the bitch don't find me
Cause she's got a gang o' kidz nappy-heads and all dirty
And she's getting pimped by a nigga that's thirty
I saw her hanging in an alley
Raggin to her friends how she's ho'in' in the valley
All by herself, doin' on the ho stroll
Comin back home late night with the bankroll
You know a bitch like that makes me sick
But I've heard that she sucks a good dick!

It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it (yeah)

At a high school dance, me and the niggas bailed in
I saw her sittin' with her friends, with the clan
So sexy, thought she was all that
She wouldn't even look at us because we wore the black hat
She was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor
But an instant prostitute behind closed doors
On the streets she's a late night feature
Walking home from school, I saw her sucking a nigga's dick under the bleachers
She saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face
But a bitch full of nut couldn't escape in the chase
A disgrace, If I ever ever saw one
There wasn't a nigga on the block late at night not getting done
So she begged me not to tell a soul
Then I said of course, cause my dick, yo, it's harder than a totem pole
Then again it don't concern me
Cause there's a slight chance if I fuck she might burn me
And then I might have to shoot the ho
I mean checking with the quickness just to let her know
But to prevent from getting sick -
I would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick

It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it (yeah)

Now I was at a club on a late late Sunday
Peeping at the bitches 'till the next day Monday
Had a couple of drinks, so I was feeling good
And suddenly I saw this bitch  that lives in my neighborhood
She went to church every week so now I lucked up
She was at the end of the bar gettin' fucked up
Back at the house she was bitch n' be ignoring
And when she start to talk the ho' was kinda boring
Yo, but now I got to dawn, see
Now she's dancing on the floor with a skirt and no panties on
Shaking that ass like a salt shaker
I already got my plans -
Just while I'm a take her to a room
But yo I mean a rest room
And stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom
So I grabbed her hand and she's wit(h) it
So when she turns sober, she'll never admit it
So while she's dropped I'd better get it quick
And see for myself if she sucks a good dick!

It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it (yeah)

""So there you have it - a job well done (She swallowed it)
But for now let me get back to what I was doing"" (She swallowed it)
Get it
What the fuck suck this dick bitch
Yeah, here comes
Ooh shit, goddamn
Goddamn
Get it all baby, get it all
Suck this dick, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy baby
Suck this dick
You know you like it
Suck it
Oh she swallowed it
She swallowed, oh shit, get it all, get it all, suck this dick, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy ..
Wait till I tell the fellas how you sucked this dick
Hey matter of fact, I want you to suck Dre's dick
Then I want you to suck Yella dick
You already sucked Ren's dick
YOU BOYS ARE DISGUSTING!
Just suck my dick bitch... cause I'm a nigga wit an attitude!"

Niggas dream about dying

I'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)

I got a case, of spittin in a motherfucker's face
So me and my ace, we got a taste
Of a motherfucker's billy club, he took his gun and
Put it to my head and said, ""Nigga start runnin""
So tell me what's the next episode?
Is he crazy, does he want to chase me or waste me?
I thought, ""Run nigga run"", but I caught myself
Because my secondary thought was death
I've got head and heart real, but still a motherfucker said
""I want another black motherfucker dead
Niggas ain't good for shit to me""
Cause it's a race for second class, so get your ass
Up against the wall bitch, and then he tried
To jump me but the punk became a victim of a walkby
Fuckin with Dre, you get a foot up in your asshole
It's just another way to let you know
Nigga send them, nigga send them, nigga send them
Punk can't fuck with me - Real motherfucking G
Straight from the streets of the CPT
Telling you why, real niggas don't die

""I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate!""

Real niggas don't die cause they eventually multiply
The niggas I'm with, they take an eye for an eye
Because the times are so wrong, gotta stay so strong
Niggas gotta keep it goin on and on
And don't let no paleface throw your ass in a snail race
Have your residence occupyin a jail space
That's what they want to do cause the system is fucked around
I try to let you know with the records that's underground
They don't give a fuck about a nigga, they would rather pull the trigger
And have you in front of a barrel smilin sayin ""Cheese!""
So nigga get smart and rebel back
I'm not with that black shit so I'm not gonna yell that
All I see is niggas getting harassed
And can't do nothin about it but get a foot in they ass, yo
But if every nigga grabbed a nine
And started shootin motherfuckers it would put 'em in line
And that's how it's supposed to be
When a pussy-ass nigga try to fuck with me
Yo, because it's useless to try
To kill a nigga cause nigga a motherfuckin real nigga don't die!

""I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate!""

Die nigga, everywhere you go
Niggas dying, niggas been dyin for 400 years

I'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)

Only the good die young, so that makes me young and bad
Puttin ass-kickings on the niggas that never had
So I guess that makes me tough shit
Straight up gangsta, wrong nigga to fuck with
So how can a nigga die, when he's causin the bloodshed
By shoot motherfuckers in the head
Tryin to make a nigga extinct because they fear me
But never wanna hear me
So I'mma let 'em know how a nigga's livin
Takin from motherfuckers cause nobody ain't givin
A damn thang! To a nigga, a real nigga
So I'm living by the motherfuckin trigger
Cause a nigga ain't afraid of bein locked up
I'm out of luck, so why should I give a fuck?
But they still want to try
To kill a nigga like me but motherfuckin real niggas don't die!

Yeah, a real nigga don't die!
Yeah motherfuckers!

Reggae,N.W.A,1991,Efil4zaggin,One Less Bitch,"The world's most dangerous group
Once again beating on your motherfucking eardrums
Doing much damage for all you slutty ass ho's

Yo, there was a bitch I knew on the avenue
She was good to G-O for a nut or two yo
I think her name was Clara
And she was guaranteed to give a motherfucka whatever he needs
To be perfectly honest, she was a hooker
So I took her a hundred yards, to the boulevard
I told her ""I'll take care of you, you take care of me
You've got a P-I-M-P and all I want is the money""
She went to work and the niggas were fiendin'
Yo, she had the biggest ass that you ever seen
In fact she was like Medusa, with titties full grown
One look and your dick turns to stone, yeah
Keepin' in mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
Because she knows I'm not to be fucked with
She ain't crazy
Fuckin' with Dre, she'll be pushin' up daisies
She was the perfect ho, but wouldn't you know
The bitch tried to gank me, so
I had to kill her
Yeah, straight hittin'
Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
Yo, I tied her to the bed, I was thinking the worst
But yo, I had to let my niggas fuck her first yeah
Loaded up the forty-fo', yo
Then I straight smoked the ho
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
I was soft and she thank me
Coughed to the boss and got tossed
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outta here and that's how it turns out

Now Vicky Vicky Vicky, she's very tricky
She put her hickey on top of my dick, sick bitch, see?
She told me she loved me and she wanted to keep me
If only she can have the dick weekly
I said I'm with it but baby you gotta hold up
If I was happy with somethin' that I could fold up
We can do this - she said her husband was rich
Then I knew I had the bitch
Yo she wrote a check, many a check
In the name of a bitch who was strugglin' at the same game
All I wanted to do was get P-A-I-D
Just a little somethin' for fuckin' me
Yo Everything was cool but Vicky concerned me
Her husband was the District Attorney
So, before he found out he was crossed up
By his bitch I was fuckin' I had her tossed up
And put to sleep, so a nigga never forgets
A dead bitch can't tell a nigga shit
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outta here and that's how it turned out

One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about!

Thinkin' about money, and lookin' at a prostitute
The bitch was cute, so now I had to execute
And shoot game like a real nigga
With a steel trigga
Convince her to move up to somethin' bigga
I think I had a flashback though
Cause I said ""fuck it""
Loped and choked and smoked to the ho' like this:
""Bitch, it's all about Dre
The money, money, money and this all I gotta say""
Of course she came with me and remained with me
'Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be
Workin' that trick shit
Cause niggas knew that she was short one
A little later though she caught one
In the chest and I knew that it was commin'
By who and how the all act would be done?
So what? One less bitch I gotta worry about
But that ain't how it turned out..

Yo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her
Straight to the muthafuckin' trigger and said ""I got her!""
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin' her in the river with cement shoes
I knew my money was comin' up short
And the thought that the stupid bitch thought she'd never get caught
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with her other nigga countin' my cash
I should've known she was like them other hoes
I told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes
Butt naked, nothin' left but the shoes
I had up a nine so they couldn't refuse
I shot the nigga, he was outta there
And tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin' chair
Now there's one less bitch I gotta worry about
Everybody out, that's how it turns out

One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about!

In reality, a fool is one who believes that all women are ladies
A nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches
And all bitches are created equal
To me, all bitches are the same
Money-hungry, scandalous groupie hoes
That's always ridin' on a nigga's dick, always in a nigga's pocket
And when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind
To me, ALL BITCHES AIN'T SHIT!

One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about!"

That you step and do your dance routine
It ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangsta scene
With a villain doin damage on a 24 track
With no confusion to finish my conclusion
Rythymatic rhymes from a radio cat
You can't take what I got coz I'll be takin it right back
Ruthless gangsta - Cold killin
You wanna know what it's means? - Definition villain
With the stupid dope rhyme
So once you hear one line you can tell it's mine
With a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin
And a look that keeps you all starin
And wondering why I'm invincible
But when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible
I don't take no shorts while I'm constructing the ground
That makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound
Girls drool on me like a diamond
(Yo Ren, tell them what they do when you start rhymin)
I go to the party, I hip, I hop the spot
I dunno what it is, but the girls get hot
Perspirin' like they're on fire and
Their so-called boyfriends with'em are retirin

Waitin' for a bumrush, gettin' to the good part
It tempts me so with temptation
Writin' my lyrics with this hyped information
This is a section of my creation
So don't say shhh! with an exclamation
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines
(Boy you should have known by now) It's mine!
Unpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed
It's irresistable, meaning that you can't avoid
And while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat
But after I rip it up I want quiet on tha' set
""Light, camera, action"" (N.W.A. take three)

I can be loud as hell, think I will? Never
Quiet on tha' set - Yeah I like that better
Cause what I can do I think I earn respect
And if I didn't from you, that's what I expect
Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't me
So who really cares how you want me to be
See, I'm just mean staying at the top of the pile
And doin' soft note tunes it ain't my style
And this concludes our program
Of how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam
Now first we take an average drum
Give it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb
It's no secret, that I sit alone at night
Pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
All kinda lyrics that's promised to play
To make everybody say

""They can be cold and ruthless no question about that
But sometimes it's more complicated""
(Yo Dre)
(You know what I want you to do?)
(Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)

Now MC Ren is here working like super glue
No matter what I do, I'm gonna stick it to you
Cause I'm the pusher, supplying the fix
And this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix
But I'm making obstacles of enemy traps
To catch any MC's with the weakest raps
Crucifyin in vain like just for usin my name
The definition is pain, but that's the thing o' the game
If they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time
Coz they're comittin a crime, and still promotin a rhyme
So, you in the back of me just listen and learn
Because you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn
Now my assignment was to give a preview
So at my next concert I wanna see you there
Not sittin in a chair standin on both feet, with yo hand in the air
Now I'm about to jet out but I'll be back
But next time expect a more funkier track
Deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
With lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion
The prove that I'm hype and you know that's bet
Now continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set"
Reggae,N.W.A,1988,Straight Outta Compton,Something Like That,"Ah yeah, yo Ren, yo ready to do this shit?
Yeah, Dre, let's rip shit up
Hey yo, Yella Boy, why don't you kick me one of them funky ass beats?
Yo, we got my homeboy Eazy E in the house
Yeah, Compton's definitely in the house
Yo Ren, what we gonna call this shit? Tell 'em what yo name is
Yeah something like that
Alright, let's kick this shit on the one
Kick it

Back by demand, now it's big as fuck
Because you as the public, you should know what's up
""Compton's in the House"" was more than gold, it was a hit
Cause it was based on some crazy shit
So our final conclusion has been permitted
Punks made us a target and knew that we'd hit it
But that was a part of showbiz
Hey yo, homeboy, why don't you tell 'em what your name is

Well for the record it's Ren, and for the street it's villain
And strapped with a gat, it's more like Matt Dillon
On ""Gunsmoke"", but not a man of the law
I'm just the baddest motherfucker that you ever saw
See, I peep and then I creep on a fool
Get my blood pressure high, but still stay cool
Dig a grave of a nigga lookin' up to me
That really had the nerve that he could fuck with me
Who was the man in the mask, while I was waitin' to ask
You know, it's MC Ren kickin' mucho ass
Gettin' respect in showbiz
Hey yo homeboy, what's up?
Why don't you tell 'em what your name is?

Dre, the motherfuckin' doctor, bitch hopper
The sucker-motherfucker stopper
Back with a vocal track that's a fresh one
So now, let's get the motherfuckin' session
Goin', flowin'. It's time to start throwin' - rhymes
So keep in mind all the suckers I'm blowin'
Cause I'm a start showin' the time
Never sayin' I'm the best and just goin' for mine
Unlike a lotta suckers who claim they're gettin' busy
When their records only make good frisbees
You need to quit runnin' off the mouth
Stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out
It's not difficult, in fact it's kinda simple
To create something funky that's original
You either talkin' 'bout the place to be
Who you are, what you got, or about a sucker MC

Oh yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, Ren
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I know what you're sayin', Dre, but you still ain't told 'em enough, man
Alright, alright
Well, let's kick one more verse right here, alright
Kick it

This is portable, something to fuck with yo ear
Ren and Dre will appear when the sound is clear
To fuck it up like we always do, and that's the trick
Sayin' some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
But it's an everyday thang
Communicating to y'all with the Compton slang
Compton's back in the house and your appartment
So open your door, by the way, so we can start it
Test the monitors and call this mic
Cause the way we feel, we're gonna fuck it up tonight
I got my mic in my hand, with a hell of a grip
Bitches screamin' and shit, now it's a trip
Waitin' for the grand finale, or the end
Or stupid rhymes set by Dre and Ren
Well, like a kid, we get new shoes and go faster
Smilin', like hell, as we move past the
Suckers, the motherfuckers with the ego hype
Well we're positive and they're on a negative type
And if think we're about to quit...
Motherfucker you ain't heard shit

Yeah, that shit was funky, you know what I'm sayin', Ren ?
I know what you're sayin', this is MC Ren and Dr.Dre
Cold kickin' it in the place
Ah yeah, my mellow Eazy E in the house
Yella Boy in the house
My boy Ice Cube
Arabian Prince cold rockin' shit
Oh yeah, hey, I'm a say whassup to my homeboys from CMW
Yeah, hey, yo Ren, whatta we gonna call this shit?
""Tell'em what yo name is?""
Yeah something like that..."
Reggae,N.W.A,1991,Efil4zaggin,Automobile,"Yo Dre man, I take this bitch out to the movies and shit
Man we're kissin' and grindin' and shit
So we hop in the back seat
You know man, this bitch rubbin' all over my dick
And frontin' like she's gonna give me the pussy, man
And the bitch said 3 words, man: ""Stop"", ""No"", and ""Don't""
I said biiiiiitch

You don't have to front on me dear
So why don't you just give that pussy here?
If you'd be good to me
Ohh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile

All that I want is a little puss'
All that I want is just a little head
If you'd be good to me
Ohh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile

You don't have to front on me bitch
Don't be afraid - it's only a dick
Give up the pussy soon
All I want is a little womb
Or get your groupie ass out my hotel room
Or get your groupie ass out my hotel room

All I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy
If you'd be good to me

FREEZE MOTHERFUCKERS!
Shoot that motherfucker!
That's mothafuckin' police
Punk mothafunka
SA PRIZE NIGGAZ!

Fuck the police! Fuck, fuck, fuck the police!
Fuck, fuck, fuck the police!
 You're motherfucking right, yo

Fuck the motherfucking police!
They don't want peace, they want a nigga deceased
So he'll cease to be a problem, and by the way the perform
It seems the Klan gave the white police another uniform
And yo the black police, the house niggas
They gave you a motherfucking gun, so I guess you figure
You made out, good to go, but you didn't know
They would stick your black ass back in the ghetto, yo
To kill another nigga, catch him with crack, in fact
Freebase - they put in the neighborhood in the first place
But the brothers ain't stupid, remember that
You got a gat, I got a gat, so whassup with that
A to the motherfuckin K
The last words you hear, then the smoke appears
Tears, from your motherfuckin family
They're starin at me, but I'm goin gun happy, fuck 'em!
Shootin everything in sight tonight's the night to get hyped
And fight for what's wrong, fuck what's right!
And by the way, my name is Dre
So listen up motherfucker to what I gotta say, yo

(Now for the first episode)
Yeah that shit's hittin man, where the volume at?
Hold-up, hold-up, hold-up, one-time, one-time, one-time
Put the joint out! Put the joint out!
Hey you motherfuckers want to step out of the car?
Don't you know it's against the law to play music so god damn loud?
Shut the fuck up! Go to jail? Or gimme that shit you was just smoking
Motherfuckers from high crime areas view the police as a threat
And that's some shit you betta not forget

Eazy E's the name feared by most
When, a lil nigga is thrown in the pen
But on the streets there's two kinds of people
White rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me
Pull over to the side, routine for me
Tearin' up my shit, like they lookin for a key of cocaine
But they never find the shit
Ain't got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit
Thinkin' everything is stolen
But can't face facts that a young black nigga's just rollin
Making more money than they ever make
Taking more shit than they ever take
Yo pigs are made to kill, and no regret and
Keep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin
Cause I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin
So let me explain a lil somethin, yo
See, I got this problem, a big problem...
Cops don't like me, so I don't like motherfucking cops

Episode Two:
Get out of the fuckin car!
Wait a god damn minute what the hell did I do?
Hey just shut the fuck up black bitch
Wait a minute, you ain't gotta be pullin me by my motherfuckin hair! Let
Go of my motherfuckin hair!
Hey just step the fuck back and shut up!
Get your motherfuckin' hands off of me!
Calm down, calm down now... listen, we're gonna go around this corner, and
You're gonna suck me and my partner's dicks, or you're gonna
Be one black dead nigga bitch

Police brutality is common in my neighborhood
That's why I hate them motherfuckers

I said fuck the police but with a little more force
And maybe now I get my point across
It's a massacre goin on, just open your eyes and look
Everyday a young nigga is took
Off the face of the street by a police
It's like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash
You can't leave out the city that they shacked up
Cause if you do that's the right they got you jacked up
It's embarassin because you know they justice, but all you can do
Is say fuck this, because if you move, that's all she wrote
So what? The excuse to shoot, or they rather stomp your head
Til you're dead with the steel-toe boot
Harassin me with some kind of mind game
Actin like a nigga just was born with a gang-name
You call that right but when you're black there's no right
Some recreational shit was only a gang fight
So shootin at the cops was a street thing
To waste time as we slanged off the cocaine
But everything was done just for peace
To retaliate, on the fuckin police, so I'm sayin

(The final episode)
Episode Three:
Hey Juan, look at the piece of ass man
Watch out watch out watch out homes!
Oh shit man you fucked up, you hit a police car
I didn't see that piece of caca!
Better act like you don't speak ingles homes
What the fuck? Get your ass out of there, I've had enough
Of your raggedy ass motherfucking shit!
Oh man no me pegues! por que me pegas? No! por favor no! No! Por que?

(It's funky fresh Eazy E) new kid on tha block
And already got a fat girl on my jock
Now my story's kinda simple, so please change the tempo
As I tell you a tale bout this big fat pimple
I was chillin' on the ave, drinkin' some brew
Saw a fatty comin' my way, so what was I to do?
I busted a U, went tha other way again
But forgot that tha avenue was a dead end
I turned around, here she came, stride for stride
Funky fat like that, bout two thirty-five
Stampede was rushin, I double looked
And she had more chins than a chinese phonebook
Five four three ugly as can be, she said

Hello Eazy E! Do you remember me? (I said no)
Huhu yes you do suga
My name is Bertha but you can call me booga
Remember the time when you were drunk at a party
We was slow dancin, give ya all this body

When she said that she loved it, I was in shock
Oh my God got a fat girl on my jock

  
She gave me tha grin, I showed tha frown
And with a bear hug picked me off tha ground
Squeezin' me tight, attempted to bug me
Grabbed me by tha rear, said 
I was hell, victim of a scandal
Coz this girl's too much for E to handle
Broke tha beast grip, started to run
Back to tha crib, grabbed tha elephant gun
She's grubbin', thighs rubbin' in a hot pursuit
I loaded up tha gun bout ready to shoot
She kept on comin' because of addiction
Legs on fire because of friction
My gun broke
I was doomed
Dropped tha double barrel, grabbed tha harpoon
As I swung, tha fat girl fell
Lyin' on tha ave just like a beached whale
That's tha story, it's quite ill
And all fat girls y'all besta chill
All overweight freaks stay off my block
Cause it's ill to have a fat girl on your jock"
Reggae,N.W.A,1991,Efil4zaggin,The Dayz Of Wayback,"What we gonna do right here is go back

Now, this is some shit that's from the days of wayback
When niggas in Compton first started to jack
When the bitches wouldn't give you no pussy
If you wasn't sellin' drugs
So many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged
They always loved that shit, they want a nigga that's sellin' keys
But nowadays, they workin' at Mickey D's
But in the days of wayback, I couldn't be laid back
Because I needed ends and I made that
I get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and
Start robbin' muthafuckas just like Cowboys and Indians
Anythin' it took to get paid
A nigga like Ren already had the plan made
And I was in it to win it and not to lose
And shit'd start blowin' up once I lit the fuse
And police couldn't touch me because I was payin' 'em
But not with no money, yo, I was sprayin' 'em
And never get caught because nobody is snitch
But one hoe did, so Ren had to shoot the bitch!
Now she's in a coffin and my life is better off and
'Cause everybody knows who's the boss and
That black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10!
So listen to me as I reminisce the days of wayback
So, check it out, y'all

It was once a time in the days of wayback
When niggas was gettin' jacked
In fact, it was when I used to pass through the
And kickin' ass through a muthafuckin' Compton Massacre
Now, let me tell you a little somethin' about Compton
When I was a kid and puttin' my bid in
Yo, Compton was like still water - just strictly calm
Now it's like muthafuckin' Vietnam
Everybody killin', tryin' to make a killin'
Niggas stealin', muthafuckas willin' to dealin'
With so many ways to come up
The average nigga didn't give a fuck
About another muthafucka in this game and
Claimin' what he claimin', livin' like he livin', killin' after killin'
Murder was a dirty job, to rob a dead man was the best plan
'Cause a dead man never ran
But now your best friend is your worst friend
Greed, kids to feed, make a me more some of what you holdin'
So, now your shit is stolen and you and your niggas start rollin'
Yo, to get your shit back ain't the word up
Muff? It's more murder, more murder, more murder
They wanna make you think that it's a crack thang or a black thang
Or some niggas in a muthafuckin' gang
But guns and money, they go together like the Ku Klux Klan
A nigga brung up and strung up
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Rememberin' the days that's past me
Yo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest
The ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test
And number one way for you to pass
Yo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass
They never in the wrong though so I made a song so
Muthafuckas would know
If your livin' situations make you wanna get a gat (a gat)
That's 'cause you livin' in the Dayz of Wayback...

Surprise, niggas!
You don't think I could do it again, did ya?
Another album!
The jokes on you, Jack!

Reggae,N.W.A,1991,Efil4zaggin,Prelude,"The motherfucking saga continues

All hail to those believin in the real gangsta shit
Cause when it comes to the real niggas
It makes the shit that much harder to deal with

Yeah, Above The Law up in this motherfucker
""Black Mafia"" for life
Down with the real niggas for life! Ha ha
Yo Sweet Talk, tell 'em what the fuck we here for!

Well alright y'all, USC, Compton, Watts
The Woods! All across the motherfuckin USA
Ye though I walk through the the valley of real niggas
I should fear no man or motherfuckin Klan, hear me one
Cause I been to the mountaintops, y'all
And I done seen through the eyes of a real nigga
(Yo, what you think about the real niggas 187?)

Yo, they make some of the coooooooolest shit I done never heard!

Yo, for me Km.G I must give it up
To the Ruthless motherfuckin gangsters
Fear no mob!

Because you're scared mon, you're scared!
Dem de pussy runnin at y'all scared mon
Bend dem silly bumba claat barber 'til de pussy claat run
BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! Keep Baby-lon on the run, seen!

The real niggas is back, cause there's too many bullshit records out
Niggas fiendin for what we put out
But you don't have to wait no longer
Because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger
So many groups made three albums or more
And that weak-ass shit is still sittin in the record store
They wonder why it never sold
Niggas rappin since the 70's and still never went gold
Our first record sold two million copies
That's because you other motherfuckers are sloppy
You came out street and crossed over
And after that your career is fuckin over
Because of that you're not around
So shut the fuck up and witness the sound of some real niggas

Yeah, motherfuckers!
Keepin' all you busters on the run in '91
Kick that shit, Ren

Most niggas can't understand
And never will if they ain't part of the Ruthless mafia clan
Niggas is dedicated to the streets
With hype fuckin lyrics and the dope-ass beats
The songs will never come soft, because I come off
So don't get in my way cause motherfucker you'll get cut off
And it's somethin you can move your lips to
To wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you
And let me now if you wanna ride the D-I-C-K
All day that's with no play
Cause ain't no rap group out that I know
That make me wanna listen to the radio
All I hear is motherfuckers tryin to make a comeback
With lovesongs, and that shit is wack
And that's why your ass ain't around
Cause you don't have the motherfuckin sound
Of a real nigga

Reggae,N.W.A,1991,Efil4zaggin,Approach to Danger,"What you want, is an unexpected approach
That may delay a suspect's awareness, of your presence
Until you have a chance to assess
The situation, you are confronted
Approach to danger... don't move
(It's hard to predict what would happen next)
(Oh shit, he has a gun!) Drop the gun
You could've prevented a tragedy

You can approach, but the danger light is blinkin
A self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinkin
This is a tribulation, the weak is judged
The prophecy was fulfilled, cause I never budge
I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme
They're seein doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream
One vision was of life, the other was death
And life didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath
So you burn in my pit that I call hell
Where you got sent, because your shit don't sell
My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke
Of the niggas that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke
I started doing them, I kept on doing them, two of them
Shoot them up until that nigga Ren was through with them
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
But fuck it, they can approach to the danger

If you can be seen, you can be hit
If you can be hit, you can be killed
(He's over there! Shoot him!)

Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangler
Out run, the shot of a gun when the game's up
Murder in the first degree, but it's worse to be
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody
With everybody thinkin of death
I kept workin, to be one of the last niggas left
So many people lookin for hope, they broke
Without checkin the fingerprints on a motherfucker's throat
A heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me
So figure to see, the D-E-A-D
Bodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary
So it's very necessary to carry
Ammunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution
Before Dre goes off
And starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the
Anger for the real nigga when I approach to danger

Approach the motherfuckin danger
(""Come back to hell and see me some time!"")
(""This is it y'all"")

Final approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner
Another dead body and you wanna keep runnin
But even the rain turns black
All you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight
No prison, nobody makes bail
Everybody gotta go but see it ain't no jail
Think about death, takin your last breath
Heart beatin like a motherfucker like it ain't no time left
With so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine
Even though they wanna make a crime, yo
Of bein real, a federal letter in the beginnin
Because of the release of ""Fuck the Police""
Fuck it I approach the danger
Cause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye
Cause in the long run (""we all die"")"

Nothin' happens. It's just another nigga dead (dead)

Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit' Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm goin' out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showin' out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix them and cook them in a pot like gumbo
Goin' off on a motherfucker like that
With a gat, that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin' when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep you dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson

Don't make me act the motherfuckin' fool

I'm knockin' niggas out the box, daily
Yo', weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T

I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jackin' the crops
Just like burglary, the definition is jackin'
And when I'm illegally armed, it's called packin'
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy, I go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho'
You'll probably get mad like them bitches are 'posed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, 'cause I'm tearin' up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker, that starts static
Not the right hand 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time, I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfuckin' Villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's takin' place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip
Straight outta Compton!

City of Compton!
City of Compton!

Eazy is his name and the boy is coming

Straight outta Compton, is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfuckin' cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kind of funny, the attitudes showin' a nigga drivin'
But don't know where the fuck he goin', just rollin'
Lookin' for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload, you see, it's about to over the hesitation
And hear's the scream of the one, who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin'
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin'
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!
This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken, by a stupid dope brotha' who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton

City of Compton!
City of Compton!"
Reggae,N.W.A,1991,Efil4zaggin,Real Niggaz (LP Version),"Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should've covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you's a sucker
Bend ya ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Don't try to hang, you best avoid
Cause my foot will be so far up you ass, you'll get hemorrhoids
Because if you try to fuck wit Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10

First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac
Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
Now how the fuck you think that rap would last
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy

Falling deep in the drums of so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and not beating, the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us

Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you
You can't harm me, alarm me
Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know
We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo
Titles are takin'
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in

It's the real thing
You are now
Real, real niggas, niggas

You can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find ya
Cause a nigga like Ren's only two steps behind ya
Don't look back, cause you're shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on
Don't step on my muthafucking stage without Nike's on
Don't say it's psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I get the right flow

All these niggas with the jibber jabber
But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because, yo, it's the shit we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But I'm a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead

Back, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see
A little streetwise nigga, you know me
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
With that hardcore hip-hop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get?
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees
Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real

Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught
So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats

They played out, that's what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we ain't happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit
Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record come, I'll come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb
You're on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up
Because if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up
Don't come in my face again, because I'm a floor ya
And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitude's a little bigga
Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas

Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad its
Sucking muthafuckas like you, making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart
A nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, N.W.A - criticized for what we say
But I'm a do this shit anyway
Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking
Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in

It's the real thing
You are now
Real, real niggas, niggas
Yeah, motherfucker, it's the real thing
You are now
Real, real niggas, niggas

N.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton

Some people call it torture
But it's what we call home
(We are the renegades of this territory
And you're the prey)
I'm the Arabian Prince (and we're N.W.A.)
Don't interfere with the sound you here
'Cause it's a dangerous groove
I'm in control of your mind and soul
Don't be afraid, just bust a move
So far from home
You're on your own
In the land of the unknown
It's the darkside, the darkside
It's called the panic zone

Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There is nothing wrong
The underworld is taking control
You're not only in dimension of sight and sound
But of mind
There's a sign post up ahead, and it reads

Reggae,N.W.A,1987,N.W.A. and the Posse,3 The Hard Way,"Here's a mix to make you move, smooth enough to soothe
Slow and lower you can go inside a bassed up groove (So funk it!)
It's gotta be, ain't no need to discuss it
(Yo Doc!) I finna kick this shit, alright! (Alright, then bust it!)

Rhymes created by the Doc, most definitely down!
I could be bitten by this brother with some bad ass brown
It ain't no joke, he needs some scope
Cause his breath is (cold!) dope
As he talks I can smell it, and I'm seeing the smoke
That's the bad breath bandit, you know what's in store
Stay away cause they breath will knock you (to the floor!)
That boy is (rough!) de soda (tough!) I don't understand
Tests his breath inside his palm, and burned his hand!
He's a tucks destroyer, a Listerine killer
A cavity employer, a yuck-mouth filler
(Say man, you bullshit!) no, that's a fact Fresh K
I wish Velamints could take his breath away
But he's.. always in effect, smelling like dead vermin
Honking the bitches with his firewalls burning
Winch his witch as a curl, just as funky as well
I mean he has a little woman that can match his smell (Yes!)
He has a girlfriend, this is not pretend
She uses deodorant that's made for men
(Scratch and sniff wallpaper all over the house)
Aww shit! (Yeah boy, that's what I'm talking about)
They need ten bars of soap, three boxes of Tide
To make them presentable to go outside
Now my story is true, and my opinion candid
But that is my tale of the bad breath bandit

 But you know, that ain't even half of the shit
 Man, what's up?
 This bitch who stay around the way, you know her K!
 Yeah?
 Y'all want to talk about her?
 Bust it!
 Oh kick her ass, man

Let's talk about girl who's a bonafide witch!
Name is Tammy, better known as bitch!
The boys in the hood all treat her like liquor
Quick is the way they pass her around and then stick her
I'm not saying she minds, she's a first class skeezer
Always on the jock, but only if he's uhh..
Man with the money and the looks to show
(So you saying she's a witch?) yeah Tammy's a material whore
You're getting laid, if you can rock a cross-fader
You got the bank, to make the bitch who'll get paid
Tagging Tammy's a process like when you use a computer
Use her and do her like they did in the old days (Shoot her!)
A whore and she knows it, yeah the knowledge is there
So they say that she's slutty and she tell them she don't care
But y'all I'm keeping my clear, even though she is pretty
(Cause we only use Tammy for a guest to the city) right on!

 But bust this, Tammy ain't the only fucked-up freak in the city
 Well who else, man?
 Aww, come on Rock, you know her now, You know her
 Seabiscuit breath, right?
 Yeah, that's her
 Yo! Go on! Bust it homes!

You stand around the bitch and your nose turns white
You ever thought about what Big Bird's shit smells like?
Well, you take that aroma, multiply it times two
And you think about Sue (Sour-smelling Sue!)
She's a girl that has the power to kill a fresh flower
Rock smelled the whore and said (Damn that bitch is sour!)
Now, I don't judge, I mean that's not what I'm thinking
People do what they want, and I guess she like stinking
But whatever the deal, I think someone should call Guiness
Cause this is kicking a scent that fucks up K's tennis shoes
And a dress, dress it fresh to impress
She really ought to be embarrassed because that girl is a mess
If you ever see her, you'll duck and cover
She looks like your sister but smells like your brother
And since they tell me Trey, honestly phrase:
I let her know that she reminded me of the Gunsmoke days
But it ain't no (thing) if she stink she'll (sing)
But to me it's like she needs a little (Irish Spring)
You ought to know what I'm saying, I hope I made myself clear
About the three ass whores, but Troll I'm out of here

Yo yo yo, these three people make me so sick that I gotta story 1988 on it
Tammy your momma ain't got no legs be talking about
I ain't gonna stand for this.. Ha ha ha ha!

Boy you sick man! You sick man! Yeah yeah

Yo man! I got a story from 1988, check it out
Sue, you got so much butter on your teeth
That when you brush your teeth you have to use a butter knife!
Ha ha ha ha!

Get ready for the king, here I come, now check this out
Sour smelling Sue got so much dirt in her ear
That she can grow potatoes, Ha ha ha ha!"

If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you

Cleaning up today, found that old Zeppelin shirt
You wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt

Say a prayer for the broken bones
'Cause who cares? We're all going home
And it won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better, you know it's gonna get better

I got one foot in the golden life, one foot in the gutter
So close to the other side, so far from the wonder
I got one foot in the golden life, one foot in the gutter
So sick of the tug of war, it keeps pulling me under

Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll

Carry on, outlast the ignorance
Moving on, survive the innocence
Won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better"

Looking on as all of life's colours seem to fade to grey

Tried to win you desperately

I will fight to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world but maybe I'll change your mind

Oh, say, do you know?
I'm a fool in a one man show
I'm a broken stereo, out of time
So how does it feel?
All alone, is it so surreal?
'Cause the ghost of survivor's guilt can be so unkind

All my life I've been waiting for moments to come
When I catch fire and wash over you like the sun
I will fight to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world but maybe I'll change your mind

The words you speak, surrounding me
This is broken love in the first degree
The air you breathe is haunting me
Maybe I'll change your mind

Light slipping through the third floor curtain
Spreading love like the morning news from the day before

Falling fast, breathing slow
Time is up, the end is just a dream
Just a dream

I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had

A few steps into the open doorway
Heart pounding, there's a noise complaint from room 304

Sirens cut through the night
Like screams set on fire, rising up higher
I've got something to prove, nothing to lose
In this city, in this city, woah

All of this time
I questioned myself
I never could wait
Looking for signs
Not asking for help
I know it's too late

A love lost and buried here, it comes to life, life
Make believe worlds make us all feel alive, live

At least that’s what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught them

She said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw

Good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught

She's really into all that self-improvement
I swear she lives in that library
But if you ask her she'll say, ""That's where you'll find me""

But if you look then you won’t find her there
She may be clever but she just acts too square
'Cause in the back of the room where nobody looks
She’ll be with her boyfriend
She’s not reading books

Felt somebody looking at me

A hideaway in Mayfair, all the great and good there
Drinking all the way to third base
Princes getting naked, falling on their faces

The story line was so ridiculous
Every single step had me begging for the next

Dragged me up the stairs and it wasn't ending there

I’m, I’m not saying I wanna be Charlie Sheen
She’s just a little bit older but I want to get to know her
She said it’s already over

So tell me what else can I do?
I bought my fake ID for you

She told me to meet her there
I can’t afford a bus fare
I’m not old enough for her
I’m just waiting ‘til I’m eighteen

I think she wants to get with me, but she’s got a job in the city
Says that she’s always too busy
She’s got a naughty tattoo in a place that I want to get to
But my mom still drives me to school

So tell me what else can I do?
I bought my fake ID for you

She told me to meet her there
I can’t afford a bus fare
I’m not old enough for her
I’m just waiting ‘til I’m eighteen
You got me waiting in a queue
For a bar I can’t get into
I’m not old enough for you
I’m just waiting ‘til I’m eighteen

In my bedroom thinking of you
Your pictures in my private folder
I know one day that I will hold her
I’ll make my move when I get older, make my move when I get older

She told me to meet her there
I can’t afford a bus fare
I’m not old enough for her
I’m just waiting ‘til I’m eighteen

It's bigger than you and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to the distance in your eyes

That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

Consider this, consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this the slip that brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing

Birds and snakes, an aeroplane
Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no, strength
The ladder starts to clatter with fear of height, down, height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site
Left of west and coming in a hurry
With the Furies breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low plane, fine, then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed

Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform, book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a votive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crush, uh-oh
This means no fear, cavalier renegade and steering clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives, and I decline

Reggae,R.E.M.,1992,Automatic for the People,Nightswimming,"Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
The photograph on the dashboard, taken years ago
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
Of recklessness and water
They cannot see me naked
These things, they go away
Replaced by everyday

Nightswimming, remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit
Around the fairest sun?
That bright, tight forever drum
Could not describe nightswimming

You, I thought I knew you
You, I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming

The photograph reflects
Every streetlight a reminder
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night"

Like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up

You can't lay a patch by computer design
It's just a lot of stupid, stupid signs
Tell her
Tell her she can kiss my ass
Then laugh and say that you were only kidding
That way she'll know that it's really, really, really, really me

Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her

Wreaked a lot of havoc on the way
Always had a smile and a reason to pretend
But their world has flat backgrounds
And little need to sleep but to dream
The sidewinder sleeps on his back

Call me when you try to wake her up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
Call me when you try to wake her up

Fall into the ocean

A fortune for the undertow
None of this is going my way

Of river poet search naiveté

Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville

And pretend I don't care that you're not here with me
'Cause it's so much easier to handle
All my problems if I'm too far out to sea
But something better happen soon
Or it's gonna be too late to bring you back

Don't go back to Rockville, don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year

It's not as though I really need you
If you were here, I'd only bleed you
But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down
And that's not how it ought to be
I know it might sound strange but I believe
You'll be coming back before too long

Don't go back to Rockville

Go it alone and hold it along

Oh, lonely deeps and hollows
Are half a world, half a world away

I didn't think, I didn't think of you
I guess that's all I needed

To go it alone and hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
And hold

Oh, this lonely world is wasted
Pathetic eyes, high-alive
Blind eye that turns to see
The storm it came up strong
It shook the trees and blew away our fear
I couldn't leave it here

To go it alone, hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Go it alone and hold it along
And hold
Go it alone and hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall

And I don't know what you mean to me
But I want to turn you on, turn you up, figure you out
I wanna take you on

These words, ""You will be mine""
These words, ""You will be mine"", all the time

The fool might be my middle name
But I'd be foolish not to say
I'm going to make whatever it takes
Bring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love
Make it rhyme, take you in, and make you mine

These words, ""You will be mine""
These words, ""You will be mine,"" all the time

I tripped and fell, and did I fall
What I want to feel, I want to feel it now
You know with love come strange currencies
And here is my appeal
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance
A word, a signal, a nod, a little breath
Just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real

These words, ""You will be mine""
These words, ""You will be mine,"" all the time

These words, ""You will be mine""
These words, they haunt me, hunt me down, catch in my throat, make me pray
Say, love's confined, on Earth"

And what it brings
Is everything
Comes calling back
A brilliant night
I'm still awake
I looked ahead
I'm sure I saw you there
You don't need me
To tell you now
That nothing can compare

You might have laughed if I told you
You might have hidden a frown
You might have succeeded in changing me
I might have been turned around
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
Leaving was never my proud
Leaving New York, never easy
I saw the light fading out

Now life is sweet
And what it brings
I tried to take
But loneliness
It wears me out
It lies in wait
And all I've lost
Still in my eyes
The shadow of necklace
Across your thigh
I might've lived my life in a dream, but I swear
This is real
Memory fuses and shatters like glass
Mercurial future, forget the past
It's you, it's what I feel

You might have laughed if I told you
You might have hidden a frown
You might have succeeded in changing me
I might have been turned around
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
Leaving was never my proud
Leaving New York, never easy
I saw the light fading out

You find it in your heart
It's pulling me apart
You find it in your heart

Nothing could bring me near
Where is the road I follow
To leave it? Leave
It's under, under, under my feet
The sea spread out there before me
Where do I go when the land touches sea?
There is my trust in what I believe

That's what keeps me, that's what keeps me
That's what keeps me down
To leave it, leave it
Leave it all behind

Shifting the dream
Nothing could bring me further from my old friend time
Shifting the dream, it's charging the scene
I know where I marked the signs
I suffer the dreams of a world gone mad
I like it like that and I know it
I know it well, ugly and sweet
I temper madness with an even extreme
That's what keeps me, that's what keeps me

I say that I'm a phantom airplane that never left the ground

I lost myself in gravity

Lift my hands, my eyes are still
I'll walk into the sea
Shoot myself in a different place
And leave it

I've longed for my release
I've waited for the calling
To leave, leave

На небесную синь, облаков кудрявый парад
И улыбаться, когда засмеётся
Нерождённый мой сын, будто я ему рад

Нелепое тело, что тупо болит
Мне бы стать сигаретой
И развеяться пеплом по ветру
Или просто лучиком света — и сиять
Но, блядь, не верится в это
Ведь я просто тело, что тупо болит
Нелепое тело, что тупо болит
Мне бы ракетой улететь на другую планету
Или болеть перестало б на этой

Когда-то я думал, что тело железное
Кушал, кирял и курил, что хотел
Щас мы с братом ходим по лезвию
На поводу наших тел, что разлагаются изнутри
Жить с этим так муторно
Словно ночь интернетить в компьютерном клубе
А дождь отсекает от утра
Ты ждёшь, и лагает ебучий стрим (сука)
Который ты смотришь от скуки за мамины бабки
Ради них читаешь книжки, ради них кладёшь закладки

Нелепое тело, что тупо болит
Мне бы стать сигаретой
И развеяться пеплом по ветру
Или просто лучиком света — и сиять
Но, блядь, не верится в это
Ведь я просто тело, что тупо болит
Нелепое тело, что тупо болит
Мне бы ракетой улететь на другую планету
Или болеть перестало б на этой
Нелепое тело, что тупо болит

Жую новейший бабл-гам в паре ультрамодных кед

А!

Эти зелёные глаза смотрят прямо в твои
Эти чёрные волосы запутывают снова
Эти белые губы говорят о любви
И ты кровью подпишешься под каждым их словом
Ты же так рад, что нашёл свой алмаз
В этой куче грязных подстилок
Друзья говорят за спиною про вас:
«Шлюха разводит дебила»
Поэтому ты их выкинул вон
Как стопку пыльных кассет
Тебе повезло — ты не такой, как все
Она не такая, как все
Твои зелёные бумажки летят в её карманы
Твой чёрный «БМВ» возит её по ресторанам
Твои белые цветы разбросаны по её хате
Ты боишься, что ей мало и когда-нибудь не хватит
Но ей похуй на цветы, и в этом вся интрига
Ей не похуй на дерьмо и ей не похуй на барыгу
Ты, конечно, её любишь, может быть, даже слишком
А она любит летать, и поэтому…

Малышка любит дилера, дилера —
Он стильный и смелый
(О-о-о, стильный и смелый)

Она играла с тобой, а ему признавалась в любви
(О-о-о, зелёный, чёрный, белый)
Её так манят каменные джунгли и их яркие огни
(О-о-о, зелёный, чёрный, белый)
Она нырнёт с головой в этот мутный трёхцветный мир
(О-о-о, зелёный, чёрный, белый)
Чтобы променять всё, что делает людей людьми
А-а-а, на зелёный, чёрный, белый
В её зелёных глазах — всё меньше зелени
А чёрные зрачки — всё больше, всё чернее
И кожа уже белее, чем снег
На виду у всех ты работаешь за чек
(Зачем?)
Ведь сахар любви давно растворился в чёрной чашке зелёного чая
Вместо принца — золотой шприц, от берегов отчаяния её лодка отчалит в никуда

Он стильный и смелый
(О-о-о, стильный и смелый)

В их бездне залитых речей и голодных взглядов

От весёлых песен, прячущих твои слёзы
От чужих глаз, что пришли сюда случайно
От сцены, где всё слишком несерьёзно

Долог наш путь до утра, но мы — готовые проткнуть небо штыки (chk chk chk)
Сколько бы не пили или дули — коли пули — дуры, с ними нам не по пути
Они не отличат нас от говна так же, как не отличают от рэпа стихи
Хи. Хи. Хи-хи-хи. Пить — вредно для психики
А жить — полезно для психики? Едва ли
Нас с парнями огонь, вода и медные трубы не плавили, не ржавили и не поломали
Балы, красавицы, лакеи, юнкера…

Мы летали до утра — будто Пушкин
Бабки, бабы и игра — всё, что нужно
Литр, два, четыре, пять — где же кружки?
Няня, я устал летать
Хочу нажраться так, чтобы ползать!
Я рождён не летать, а ползать
Я рождён не летать, а ползать
Я рождён не летать, а ползать

Чёрная ночь (блэк найт), чёрный рыцарь
Бальзам на душу (лей-лей) населения
Мне белый конь (смелее), скоро тридцать —
Бальзак (иллюзии горят, как поленья!)

У синего моря без невода, но с девами ползал
Пил жидкое горе, хоть знал — от него нет пользы
Я хороший, просто хотел угореть
По злу
С теми, кого
Люблю
И вот теперь
Ползу к финишу

Одинокий ублюдок
Мне б просто рыбки-дырки поменять
На золотые зубы
Поздно: ювелирка, твою мать
Заперта, и я должен забить
А чтобы летать, я должен зажечь
И чтобы ползти, я должен налить
И должен запить, чтобы забыть…

Эй, слышь, ты просто пуля
Самая спросовая чикуля

Время для камеры поцелуев

Срок годности — до двадцати
Уровень годности — выше не найти
Как для Муромца Ильи — камень на перепутье
Дала мне на выбор три варианта — дай мне все три
И я готов к тому, что не вернусь обратно
Иначе не пришёл бы в логово разврата
Люблю, когда дамы одеваются аккуратно
Но ещё больше люблю, когда они раздеваются аккуратно
Не лезь в мои карманы — там не будет денег
Здесь они мне не нужны: меня и так все знают

Видя меня, потеют, будто ёбнув папин «Камри»
Я знаю, что это не стоит и единой мысли
Но я хочу сейчас, сейчас собака в этой киске
Всех сук этих не было рядом, я конец всему тут, без вариантов
Я на трёх синих батлах и таблах, за руку ведёт меня куда-то в ванну (в ванну)

Reggae,ЛСП (LSP),2017,Tragic City,Конец света (End of the World),"Нас с утра разбудил мой
Растреклятый мобильный
О мой Бог (кто мне)
В такую рань мог (посмел)
Звонить, м-м?
Сонно беру трубку
И сначала за шутку
Принял слова, от которых жутко стало вмиг (хо-о-о!)
Холодный голос проговорил:
«Мы из комитета
По концам света
Уведомляем: сегодня ваша планета
Будет уничтожена…
Простите, что потревожили…»
И гудки, и-и-и-им
Я вряд ли б поверил, но
Странный голос словно ввёл меня в гипноз
Ну хоть не сдохну один, как бродячий пёс (р-р-р!)
Ведь чтобы умереть в один день, как в сказке

Я выбрал тебя осознанно
Я выбрал тебя, чтобы под звёздами
Среди летающих тарелок
Пе-перестрелок
Ни в чём не бывало с тобою гулять
Я выбрал тебя
Мы будем улыбаться, как дети
Когда придёт время

Что ж, это холодное место
Моя душа прозябала (бр-р-р!)
Рожа из зеркала, если честно, тоже подзаебала —
День сурка, поэтому с утра влипал в PS'ку
Телевизор, телефон — телебегство
От уёбищного мира, где жить скучно (скучно жить!)
Где, теряя новизну, любимые игрушки
Как груши, сгнивали на дне пыльного ящика
Скорее бы его взорвали долбоящеры!
Сейчас среди всех моих игрушек (всех)
Ты — самая любимая, почти что настоящая
Теряю голову — без неё лучше
Ведь тут лишь дураки счастливы
Ты с коньяком, я с косяком
Пойдём на балкон
Там дико красиво
Звёзды горят, как бы говоря:
Нам пора, и я рад, что (и я рад, что)

Выбрал тебя осознанно (и я рад, что)
Выбрал тебя, чтобы под звёздами
Среди летающих тарелок
Пе-перестрелок
Ни в чём не бывало с тобою гулять
Выбрал тебя
Мы будем улыбаться, как дети
Когда придёт время умирать
*Дроп*

Выбрал я, выбрал я, выбрал
Выбрал я, выбрал я, выбрал
Выбрал я, выбрал я, выбрал
Выбрал я, выбрал я, выбрал
Среди тарелок, перестрелок
Ни в чём не бывало
Мы будем улыбаться, как дети, когда придёт время

Лазеры жгут за редутом редут
Земля горит под ногами, а они ведут
Нас сами отчаянно
Помнишь ту неуютную чайную?
Тут обсуждали мы планы робко
А по ночам — блуд
На полу моей хрущёвки
Старой планировки
Стоп-кадр! Перемотка…
От дороги из горячих кирпичей
Нас спрячет харчевня
Не более уютная
Ну и там снова нам нальют вина
Чтобы тебя утешить, Саша…
Ведь это лишь моя вина
Что не придумал, куда ехать дальше
Ни сейчас, ни тогда
Так поехали, а лучше, полетели даже
Туда, в ту неделю нашу
Где мы пополам делим
Что, где и когда, уже на двоих, Саша
Посмотри — машут
Нам с Земли (люди на прощание)
Нам ли? (не отпускай меня)
Нам ли? (не отпускай меня)
Нам ли? (не отпускай меня)
На-а-ам (отпускай меня)

Я вчера во сне плавал
Все рыбы мне кричали: «Браво!»
Пираньи, дельфины и киты —
Теперь мои лучшие кенты
Ночью в море все тёмно-синее
И ощущения такие сильные
Что, устав рассекать за волной волну
Хочется просто пойти ко дну

Я застрял навсегда, застрял навсегда
Застрял навсегда в новом мире, раскрашенном в синий
Только в синий
Я застрял навсегда, застрял навсегда
Застрял навсегда в новом мире, раскрашенном в синий

Я сегодня во сне летал
Мир птиц и самолётов — мне так нравится он
Белые крылья и белый металл
Мне стал важнее всего
Ночью в небе всё тёмно-синее
И ощущения такие сильные
Что, устав выполнять любой ветра каприз
Хочется просто упасть вниз

Я застрял навсегда, застрял навсегда
Я застрял навсегда в новом мире, раскрашенном в синий

Я застрял навсегда, застрял навсегда

Я завтра во сне умру
И мне придётся встретить всех мёртвых близких и друзей
Один за одним они мимо пройдут
Чтоб один на один оставить меня с ней
Её глаза синие
И ощущения такие сильные
Что хочется просто обнять её и не отдать никому
Но я вспомнил, почему, почему…

Его прикончил мой первый враг
Я бы хотел, чтоб не стало нас двух
Было бы проще, но вышло не так
Он был обречён — значит, вроде как я ни при чём
Это ебучее «вроде»
Мой последний друг улетел, как с балкона бычок
И погас вместе с окнами дома напротив…

Что за него она готова утонуть в чужих грязных руках
И растаяла в них, как шоколад
Пока я, сгнивая, плевал в потолок
Девчонка-плохиш меня предала
За бочку дерьма, жаль, что я б так не смог…

Воедино слились в ней трое —
Леди, шлюха и дура

Е-е-её маникюра
Она щадит нейроны —
Не пьёт, а нюхает пудру
Пальцем её не трону
Но возьму тебя штурмом
Хоть я пилот, а ты штурман —
Крепче держи мой штурвал
Пускай, воспитан я дурно
И мало что видел, кроме дерьма
Но свой кусок я урвал
И выпью сок твой до дна
А капли на дорогих простынях —

Потому что за моей спиной ад? Брось, слышь?

Как бы не упасть
Ведь домашние кошки (мяу)
Плохо знают дворовых котов
Зачем уважать твою власть
Если я уже увлажнил твою пасть?

А вот отброс с тобой не готов

Негатив — это всё, что вынес с городской свалки отброс
Через боль и страдания проходит огранку мой алмаз

Ты сама, куколка, настолько пуста

И мы поселились в моём замке чёрном

Я так хотел раскрасить мир в яркие цвета
Но в моих акварелях была ядовитою вода
Я знал, что все шансы по пути растерял
Но снова и снова краски по листу растирал

Рыл могилу, наслаждаясь процессом…
И теперь я даже рад, если честно
Что на двоих в ней достаточно места…

А, а хули — YOLO! Потом нам было хуёво
Обоим. Но не бойся
Это в прошлом. Успокойся

Но я гиена и змея — и сам
Себе набросал кучу очков
Сам же себе и поставлю блок
Прошлое тает в руках — шоколадный сырок
Меня поливали дерьмом, так
Что я чуть было в нём не утоп
Но силы собрав в кулак
Себя за волосы вытянуть смог
Сколько осталось на табло?
Всё равно я отмотаю срок
От звонка до звонка кто же поможет?
Чёрт знает — может, и Бог!

Я и ты — мы просто дети белого гетто (е)
Оно само расставило за нас приоритеты (да)
Моя душа болит без девок, бабок и таблеток
Секс — как власть, деньги — как средство
Таблетки — как выход в никуда — из ниоткуда
Мне двадцать пять — уже лет пять, как я не жду чуда
Реальность — чудо-юдо, а кругом хуёвые
Мастера Йоды говорят: «Руби ему головы
Прижигай их йодом!»
Да хуй там плавал — сизифов труд
Затянутся все его раны, как тиной — пруд
Он на башке моей упрямо сидит, как спрут
Его глаза мне говорят: он будет тут, пока я не умру
Они не врут! И не менее честно
Щупальцами тычут мне в морду интересы
Труд-труд, чтобы было больше песо
Чтобы дотянуться до звёзд — ради пёзд, псов, веса
Мы просто дети белого гетто
Оно само расставило за нас приоритеты
Моя душа болит без девок, бабок и таблеток
Секс — власть, деньги — средство, таблетки — метод
Но есть же что-то ещё?

Если у меня будут большие деньги — я положу их на счёт
Если, кто спросит, чем занят мой подельник — отвечу, что не знаю ни о чём
Дорогая, ты загляденье, скрась моё свободное падение… чёрт

Е! М-м-м… Что-то ещё!
Что? Что? Что? Что? Что-то ещё!
Что? Что? Что? Что? Что-то ещё!

Но как это найти?
Столько разных «что-то» было на моём пути:
Раньше я думал, это книги, музыка, игры, интернет — ни хуя
Думал, что это друзья, думал, что это любовь, думал, что это семья
Щас моя душа болит без девок, бабок и таблеток
Но боль уже почти незаметна
Ведь они не задают вопросов и не дают ответа
На вопрос «Что мне нужно?» — поэтому мне не нужно всё это!
А пока на балконе притона я пьяный, шатаясь, курю сигарету
И чувствую, будто я Бэтмен и щас улечу на другую планету
Рядом со мной мои люди, и мы должны выебать мир — и мы делаем это
Остальное — хуйня, быть может, потом когда-нибудь и у меня будут дети
Не факт, что из гетто — и они смогут сами расставить приоритеты
Жить без шлюх, грязных денег, ёбаных таблеток
И стать рассветом человека
Сохранив в себе потребность в чём-то ещё!

Если у меня будут большие деньги — я положу их на счёт
Если, кто спросит, чем занят мой подельник — отвечу, что не знаю ни о чём
Дорогая, ты загляденье, скрась моё свободное падение… чёрт
Моя душа болит без девок, бабок и таблеток! (А-а!)

Пела песни нашего детства так, как дети их не поют

Я сижу в этой столовой уже 25 лет
Пережёвывая этот монотонный винегрет
(И я слышу только:) «Ешь, ешь, ешь, что дают!
Ешь, ешь, что дают, ешь, что дают!»

Пережёвывая этот монотонный винегрет
(И я слышу только:) «Ешь, ешь, ешь, что дают!
Ешь, ешь, что дают, ешь, что дают!»

А пока я возле школы копаюсь в своём прошлом
Оборзевшие мажоры Лену жарят, как картошку
Посыпая порошками, как будто приправой «Магги» —
Ну а днём она маме помогает мыть пол в универмаге
Юля двух детей ловко пристроила в приют
Чистит богачам морковки в египетском раю
Она спокойна, ведь знает, что государством дети воспитаны
А тех, кто обижает её — сразу пиздят битами
Евгений грёб грязную капусту лопатой
И Колю-корешка подсадил на иглу —
Николай теперь похож на корнишон и продал хату
А Женю ОБН посадил, как свеклу
И, как свекла, Оксана, красная, под гастрономом —
Свою жизнь связала с обоссанным астрономом
С бутылкой вина в руках и с родною лапой под юбкой
Поёт песни нашего детства так, как дети их не поют

Я сижу в этой столовой уже 25 лет
Пережёвывая этот монотонный винегрет
(И я слышу только:) «Ешь, ешь, ешь, что дают!
Ешь, ешь, что дают, ешь, что дают!»

Пережёвывая этот монотонный винегрет

Просто ещё один падший ангел в этом кромешном раю
Я слышу только: «Ешь, что дают! Ешь, ешь, ешь, что дают!»
Знаю, я тоже вряд ли приведу свои шашки в дамки —
И лишь поэтому, конечно, пою: «Ешь, что дают! (Ешь, что дают!)»

Я сижу в этой столовой уже 25 лет
Пережёвывая этот монотонный винегрет

«Нет! Это полная чушь!» — её глаза говорят мне
В то время, как рука в блестящих часах
Роняет на пол холодный тесак
Пока тело кровоточит
Двери лифта моментально отрежут меня от этой ночи

А шея твоя трепетала не только от поцелуев

Когда глаза горят как агат и агат

Я поставил шах и мат
Ты не хочешь и не можешь обратно
Я на тебе, как на войне, не теряя пыла
Но чую к нам крадётся с тыла чужой солдат

Что ты его полюбила

А, а

Помню 97-й год: я спросил у мамы за хип-хоп
Мне ответили: «Его танцует и поёт нигерский сброд»
Бигги в тот год получил пулю в лоб
2001-й — за школьной партой
Все слушали «Касту», а я — «Рабов Лампы»
2005-й — все нюхали клей
С мобилы включая Тупака
Включали «Бутырку», бухая в подъезде
Круга — бухая в квартире
Певица МакSим для лишения чести
Прыщавых пиздёнок звучала в эфире
А я слушал Марли, я читал книги
Я писал рифмы, я слушал Бигги
Покупал у бабы Жени поштучно сиги
Смотрел, как Коби был лучшим в лиге
2007-й — все повисли на Лиге, «Спайс Гёлз»
В восьмом умер мой ниггер — передоз
Порвал сердце, как под 808-е Каньей в тот же год
Год 9 — вышел фильм «Ноториус»
Теперь все забыли про Бигги Смолса
А большинство тут и вовсе не секут
Насколько крут был Би-Ай-Джи

Я — прям как Бигги
Я тоже много падал, как падал Бигги
И я готов сдохнуть, как сдох Бигги
Чтоб жить после смерти, как жив Бигги
Над вами большой папа — прям как Бигги
И рубль будет падать, как падал Бигги
Но вы не готовы сдохнуть, как сдох Бигги
Чтоб жить после смерти, как жив Бигги

Каждый день — будто понедельник, а понедельник —
Это понедельник, даже если ты бездельник
Сука на суке на суке, хоть я и без денег
Дни прогорают в самбуке, что принёс для сук подельник
Я ничего не вижу, глаза закрыты
Мониторами-дисплеями, как повязками
Я всех ненавижу, ты всех ненавидишь
Мы всех ненавидим — и этим повязаны
Но каждому слепому всё не видно по-разному
Я всё ещё помню, какова реальность
Мне есть, что сказать, есть, что доказывать
Как Бигги, мои рифмы — слепая ярость
Нахуй мир, рабский труд, левый хайп, белых сук
Делать стиль прямо тут, чекай кайф — в этом суть
Все мои люди со мной, как один
Все мои суки со мной, как одна
И блядь, мы получим всё, что хотим
Даже не всплывая со дна

Я — прям как Бигги
Я тоже много падал, как падал Бигги
И я готов сдохнуть, как сдох Бигги
Чтоб жить после смерти, как жив Бигги

Под крик винилов самых модных групп
Почему же внутри так пусто?
Ни намёка на чувства
Может быть, слишком много прохавал он
Может быть, докопался до самого дна
Раз за душу трепался с дьяволом
Мол, она ему

Хоть бы кто другой, только б не она
Но нет надежды покинуть этот кошмар
Он бы продал душу дьяволу, но она ему

Пять суток ночь — чёрт знает что
Мыши-пассажиры тихонько дрожат в каютах
Типа «Мы же ещё живы, значит, всё круто»
Как будто весь корабль просто вымер
Лишь иногда молния вскрывает силуэт
Что стоит у штурвала и глазами слепыми
Смотрит не за горизонт, а сквозь пелену лет

И если это не твоя вина —
Значит, это не твоя война
Капитан, я вижу труп за бортом
И ещё один труп за бортом
И если это не твоя вина —

И сам командир так же пропитан тоской
И щёки высушены солью — не только морской
Он сам стал деталью судна
Сразил толпы пиратов и девок распутных
Пережил свист свинца, и золота груды
Скрывает его каюта, но вот настал день судный

Только он один смерти дождя не дождётся

Кто-то заметит труп за бортом, но юнга потом
Радостно крикнет «Земля!» пересохшим ртом
И мир навсегда забудет труп за бортом"

Застряла могильной плитой в чьей-то голове

Их летит миллиард
Значит, всем нам лучше смотреть
Не только под ноги
Холодная смерть
Найдёт слишком многих
И от всех неуклюжих кретинов (кретинов)
Не оставит ничего, кроме дымящихся ботинок
Кто-то вышел отлить, накидавшись в клубе —
Звезда без проблем оборвёт его путь
Как и тех, кто нагнулся поднять грязный рубль
Или просто залип на женскую грудь

Шепнул, что есть место, где дождь не идёт
Там люди пьют пиво, смеются и смотрят в экран
На котором мы гибнем
Но где-то шныряет безумный ублюдок
Который отучит вонючие рты говорить не о том
Просто выгнав под дождь
Чтоб неспешно их побирал чёрт
На наших костях вы построили чудо
Под купленным за наше счастье метеоритным зонтом
Держите его покрепче, и помните:
Каждый зонт рано или поздно протечёт

*Lil Smooky on the beat*
А!

Я покажу тебе фокус, фокус
Дэвид Копперфилд наших дней. Уличная магия, Дэвид Блейн
Я покажу тебе фокус, фокус
Сим-салабим, мой фокус неповторим, но снова
Я покажу тебе фокус, фокус
Крибле-крабле-бумс, ты уже без чувств
А я не потеряю свой фокус, фокус
Мои треки, деньги, плюс всё, с чем я ебусь —
Лишь на этом мой фокус

Абра, Кадабра, Алаказам! (Покемон)
Это с улицы «правда» (true), где-то между Вязов и Сезам
Это музыка завтра — не нужен «Шазам»
Она бьёт по мозгам
Мой фокус, как адреналин, бьёт по глазам ей
Один из которых днями смотрит в телефон, а второй — в телик
С тобой инспектор Гаджет — но нужен тебе не он, а кот Феликс
Я тот самый кот Феликс, дворовой
Но тыща фокусов со мной
И ты щас бросишься за мной
Ведь тыща зелёных листиков со мной
Так что зови меня — Мистер Фикус
А я зову тебя на променад в мой невисячий сад
Рычи, кусай, ты — самый красивый в мире Мистер Пиклз
У меня твой любимый маринад, и…

Я покажу тебе фокус, фокус

А я не потеряю свой фокус, фокус
Мои треки, деньги, плюс всё, с чем я ебусь —
Лишь на этом мой фокус

Когда я его демонстрирую
То даже на миг забываю о всяком дерьме
Она вибрирует, ви-ви-вибрирует
Как будто на неё звонит кто-то мне (опять звонит кто-то)

Помнишь, был чел? Сел чел! Нет чела — вот так фокус
Другой — бегущий, как Шварц: отдел весь год уже крутит глобус
Мне платят чек, у меня есть чек, я бросаю чек на ловкость
Каждый мой ёбаный день, пережить этот ёбаный день — вот так фокус
И вот поэтому вместо любви в глазах у меня ты увидишь пропасть
Считаешь меня карманным своим полу-Рокко Сиффреди, полу-Крисом Роком?
Не думай, блядь, что я твой шут! Тебя веселят — тебя отъебут
Это я веселюсь, это я ебу. Пикабу-у-у!

Олеги ЛСП, 614, ЛСП Олеги…
А!

Сумасшедший хиппи стал моим отцом
Металлистка в рваных джинсах стала мамой
Ночью часто я ношу очки от солнца
Танцевать десять часов подряд — мне мало
Лежу на облаках, смеюсь в небесный потолок
И с тех, кого его лазурный блеск давно манит
И если есть где-то на свете Бог
Значит, это он оставил что-то у меня в кармане

Я потерял свой плот, меня волной несёт
Небо в моих глазах, и наплевать на всё
Ветер, гони волну, чтоб я быстрее плыл
Может, хоть так верну всё то, что я любил

Залипаю в телевизор и тащусь
На столе стоят пепельница и пиво
Кажется, что мне пора сходить к врачу —
Всё в теле и душе, наверное, уже сгнило
Но раз ещё живой, то лучше я пойду тусить
А доктор пусть немного подождёт меня в могиле
И если есть где-то на Марсе жизнь
Значит, будет с кем трепаться на балконе по мобиле

Я потерял свой плот, меня волной несёт
Небо в моих глазах, и наплевать на всё
Ветер, гони волну, чтоб я быстрее плыл
Может, хоть так верну всё то, что я любил

Я ничего не понимаю, мне совсем не интересно
Мне плевать на этот город, его радио и честность
Мне плевать на мою тёлку, её моду и наивность
Думаю, что всё это взаимно
Но мне не плевать на море
Но мне не плевать на небо
Но мне не плевать на солнце
Но мне не плевать на ветер
На самый быстрый ветер, который всё изменит!

Я потерял свой плот, меня волной несёт
Небо в моих глазах, и наплевать на всё
Ветер, гони волну, чтоб я быстрее плыл
Может, хоть так верну всё то, что я любил
Я потерял свой плот, меня волной несёт

А слова — чешуя вещей?

Красное — от тополей
Будто вместе с тобою
Ушло безвозвратно
И кто что потерял —
К чему считать?
Ведь всё, что происходит
Зовут любовью
И может, напрасно

Рой зелёных светящихся мух в закрытых глазах. Я просто упал
Не поднимут все 33 богатыря. Всё это зря! Много терял (много)
Килограммы друзей. Тебя…
Яркие фантики, горки улыбок, дым тёмного клуба
Выгляжу глупо, выглядишь мило. Две параллели — мои-твои губы
Прыгал как тигра. (Прыгал как тигра)
Играл в свои игры. (Играл в свои игры)
Читал твои мысли
Но в неправильных книгах. (Но в неправильных книгах)

Мир стал пустым без тебя, а-аа
Без тебя, а-аа
Без тебя
Мир стал пустым без тебя, а-аа
Без тебя, а-аа
Без тебя

Осень вторым дыханием поднимет меня на пирамиду из стульев
Теперь мои ноги — как сталь, сердце — как камень, мысли — как пули
Я был цветным, меня научили, думал, тебе так понравится
Сейчас я монохромен — и ничего, кроме портвейна, по пятницам
Так забавно быть, как робокоп, — железной и надёжной правдой
Почти выкинул твой гроб в окоп возле крепости моего «завтра»
А ты пришла и спустила курок, сталь ног превратила в творог
Сердце из камня — в поролон, а мысли — в машины под твоим окном

Мир стал пустым без тебя, а-аа
Без тебя, а-аа

Мир стал пустым без тебя, а-аа
Без тебя, а-аа

Утром я в беленьких шортах пойду и почищу зубы и
Всё забуду и… Всё забуду и… Всё забуду и… Всё забуду

И я решил потеплее что-то надеть
Выбрал сотню твоих слов, самых сильных по мощности
И закутался в них: в моём городе можно всё
После обеда обычно гуляю по парку с плеером
Плавают между ушей слова, которым мы верили
Закрываю глаза, двигаюсь размеренно
Танцуя танец, который так греет меня

Дома я греюсь у костра из мебели
И из твоих писем, как бы дороги не были
Они… Ты когда-то строчила их у окна
Сейчас им цена — полчаса огня
И я думал, у судьбы не получится отнять
Тебя
Но думать не вредно
Нарядно оделась ты в день наш последний
Сказав: «Оставляю на память тебе мой любимый танец»

Я вкрутую сварил три яйца (как всегда)
И позавтракал
А потом упал на кухне и лежал лет тридцать
Сейчас уверен, у тебя отлично всё
И я, допустим, не угасаю
Кстати, тебя уже не помню фактически
Но когда мне грустно, иногда спасает…

Fly paper, penny loafers, Lucky Strike Green
Flat tops, sock hops, Studebaker, Pepsi please
Ah, do you remember these?
Cigar bands on your hand, your daddy's socks rolled down
Styx nose plugs and aviator caps with flaps that button down
Movie stars on Dixie Cup tops and knickers to your knees
Ah, do you remember these?
The hit parade, grape Tru-Aid, the Sadie Hawkins dance
Pedal pushers, duck tail hair, and peggin' your pants
Howdy-Doody, Tutti-Frutti, the seam up the back of her hose
Ah, do you remember those?
James Dean, he was keen, Sunday movies were taboo
The senior prom, Judy's mom, rock and roll was new
Cracker Jack prize, stars in your eyes, ask daddy for the keys
Ah, do you remember these?
The bogeyman, lemonade stand, and takin' your tonsils out
Indian burn and wait your turn and four foul balls you're out
Cigarette loads and secret codes and savin' lucky stars
Can you remember back that far?
To boat neck shirts and fender skirts and crinoline petticoats
Mum's the word and a dirty bird and a double root beer float
Moon hub caps and loud heel taps and he's a real gone cat
Ah, do you remember that?
Dancin' close, little moron jokes, and cooties in her hair
Captain Midnight, Ovaltine, and The Whip at the County Fair
Charles Atlas Course, Roy Roger's Horse, and only The Shadow knows
Ah, do you remember those?
Gable's charm, Frog in your arm, loud mufflers, pitchin' woo
Going steady, Veronica and Betty, white bucks, and Blue Suede Shoes
Knock Knock jokes: Who's there? Dewey. Dewey who?
Do we remember these? Yes we do. Ah, do we, do we remember these"
Reggae,Grateful Dead,1977,Terrapin Station,Terrapin Station,"Lady with a Fan
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
Till my tale is told and done
While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'till things we've never seen
Will seem familiar
Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago
Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there
Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den
""Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance""
The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold
Terrapin Station
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin
Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
(Oh)
From the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - but the train's put it's brakes on
And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin
At a Siding
While you were gone
These faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden
With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin
Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again
For good or ill again"
Reggae,Grateful Dead,1970,American Beauty,Ripple,"If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
Would you hold it near as it were your own?
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home"
Reggae,Grateful Dead,1974,From The Mars Hotel,Scarlet Begonias,"As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try
She had rings on her fingers and
Bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was
Into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls
In the thick of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and
Was closing the door
I had one of those flashes:
I'd been there before
Been there before
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right
Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a
Touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band

Reggae,Grateful Dead,1970,American Beauty,Truckin’,"Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings
Dallas, got a soft machine;
Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no
Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me ""You've got to play your hand""
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is ""Ain't it a shame""
Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been
Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now get back truckin' home"
Reggae,Grateful Dead,1970,American Beauty,Friend of the Devil,"I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night till the morning came around
Set out runnin but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills
Set out runnin but I take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air
Set out runnin but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you
What do you want me to do
To watch for you while you are sleeping?
Then please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming, too
Look into any eyes you find by you
You can see clear through to another day
Maybe it's been seen before through other eyes
On other days while going home
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago
Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through
Just a box of rain
Wind and water
Believe it if you need it
If you don't, just pass it on
Sun and shower, ind and rain
In and out the window like a moth before a flame
And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there"

I see you've got your fists out, say your piece and get out

Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

I will get by

The ABC's we all think of
To try to give a little love

It's even worse than it appears but it's alright
Cow is given kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene but it's alright

The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit because it's alright

She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double. Pays my ticket when I speed
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet. She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow. Waits backstage while I sing to you
Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm. Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love for spring, fall, and winter. She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell, caught up in sunlight, come on out singing;
I'll walk you in the sunshine. Come on honey. Come along with me
She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need:
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight. Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is half way down...
Sometimes when the night is dying, I take me out, and I wander around. I wander 'round
Sunshine daydream walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, breathing more freely
Ride our singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, Sunshine daydream walking in the sunshine"

Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone
Goin' to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

River gonna take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
Its a far-gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, Mama many worlds I've come
Since I first left home

In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside I will lay my head
Going home, going home, by the riverside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

Going to plant a weeping willow
On the banks green edge it will grow
Grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside I will lay my head
Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul"
Reggae,Grateful Dead,1980,Go to Heaven,Althea,"I told Althea I was feeling lost
Lacking in some direction
Althea told me upon scrutiny
My back might need protection
I told Althea that treachery
Was tearing me limb from limb
Althea told me: now cool down boy
Settle back easy Jim

You may be Saturday's child all grown
Moving with a pinch of grace
You may be a clown in the burying ground
Or just another pretty face
You may be the fate of Ophelia
Sleeping and perchance to dream
Honest to the point of recklessness
Self centered to the extreme
Ain't nobody messing with you but you
Your friends are getting most concerned
Loose with the truth
Maybe it's your fire
But baby...don't get burned
When the smoke has cleared, she said
That's what she said to me
You're going to  want a bed to lay your head
And a little sympathy
There are things you can replace
And others you cannot
The time has come to weigh those things
This space is getting hot
You know this space is getting hot

I told Althea
I'm a roving sign
That I was born to be a bachelor
Althea told me: Ok that's fine
So now I'm out trying to catch her

Can't talk to you without talking to me
We're guilty of the same old thing
Talking a lot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring"

If you've got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track

I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Heard some say: Better run away
Others say: You better stand still
Now I don't know but I been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand I have heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead
Who can deny? Who can deny?
It's not just a change in style
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles?
Spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
Things went down we don't understand
But I think in time we will
Do we keep on coming or stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late?
You can't overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide
Spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will
I don't know but I been told
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load
I don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too long
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another

Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back
Comic book colors on a violin river crying leonardo
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee"

Get up, get out, get out of the door

Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a livin, we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

Long distance runner, what you holdin out for?
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor
You gave all you had. why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake

The wolves are running 'round
The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

When I awoke, the dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, ""Come on in""

Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the queen of spades
But the cards were all the same

Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Don't murder me

In the backwash of Fennario
The black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due
While the boys sing round the fire

In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills


Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

Fortune comes a-crawling,Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?"

Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

Brown-eyed women and red grenadine

Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

Tumble down shack on Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hick'ry just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

Reggae,Grateful Dead,1973,Wake of the Flood ,Weather Report Suite,"Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade, and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain
Golden hills, now veiled in gray
Summer leaves have blown away
Now what remains? The wind and rain
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (flowing)
Flowing 'till the waters all are dry (flowing)
The loving in her eyes
Circle songs and sands of time
And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme
And little change
The wind and rain
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (flowing)
Flowing 'till the rivers all are dry (flowing)
The loving in her eyes
(Winter gray and falling rain)
(We'll see summer come again)
(Darkness falls and seasons change)
Gonna happen every time
(Same old friends the wind and rain
We'll see summer by and by
Summers fade and roses die
(You'll see summer come again)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky

Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea
She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her
Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear!
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again!
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield!
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout ""I am! I am! I am! I am!""
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of men
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout ""I am! I am! I am! I am!"""

You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own"

May the four winds blow you safely home

Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

You ask me where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
Ring like fire when you lose your way

Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

God help the child who rings that bell
It may have one good ring left, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused just listen to the music play
Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest wind

Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

In Franklin's tower the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

Roll away the dew
You'd better roll away the dew

I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn, tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me

Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes now, here she starts:
Hear her cry

Wheel to the storm and fly

Nothing to tell now

And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter
And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended, he had to die, you know he had to die

If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hell
Look out
Look out
The candyman
Here he come
And he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't
Got no friend
Till the Candyman
Comes 'round again
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey 'round
Want you to tell everybody you meet
The Candyman's in town
Look out
Look out
The Candyman
Here he come
And he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't
Got no friend
Till the Candyman
Come 'round again
'round again"
Reggae,Grateful Dead,1972,Europe ’72,Jack Straw,"We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go;
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?

Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, burns my eyes to see;
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

We used to play for silver, now we play for life;
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightnin' out of Sante Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride

There ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much
Too slow

We can share the women, we can share the wine"
Reggae,Grateful Dead,1975,Blues for Allah,Help on the Way / Slipknot!,"Paradise waits on the crest of a wave, her angels in flames
She has no pain, like a child she is pure, she is not to blame
Poised for flight, wings spread bright, spring from night into the sun
Don't stop to run, she can fly like a lie, she can't be outdone
Tell me the cost, I can pay, let me go, tell me love is not lost
Sell everything, without love day to day insanity's king
I will pay day by day, anyway, lock, bolt and key
Crippled but free, I was blind all the time, I was learning to see
Help on the way, well, I know only this, I've got you today
Don't fly away cause I love what I love and I want it that way
I will stay one more day, like I say, honey, it's you
Making it too, without love in a dream, it will never come true
Honey, it's you
Making it too
Without love in the dream
It will never come true"
Reggae,Grateful Dead,1974,From The Mars Hotel,Ship of Fools,"Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down but whoa it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools"

You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

Where have all the people gone my honey
Where have all the people gone today
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

Running from your window
I was all night running, running, running
I wonder if you care?
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Run smack into a tree

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

Dressed myself in green
I went down to the sea
Try to see what's going down
Try to read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
Turned around to see
Heard a voice a-calling, calling, calling
You was coming after me
Back to me

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

Ran into a rainstorm
Ducked into a bar door
It was all night pouring, pouring rain
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Until the sun goes down
Till it go down

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please

Reggae,Grateful Dead,1970,American Beauty,Attics of My Life,"In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me
I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me
In the book of love's own dream
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my lights grow old
When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You
Flew
To me
In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me"
Reggae,Grateful Dead,1978,Shakedown Street,Stagger Lee,"1948, Christmas eve, with a full moon over town
Stagger Lee shot Billy DeLions
And he blew that poor boy down
Do you know what he shot him for?
What do you make of that?
Because Billy DeLions threw the lucky dice
Won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat
Bayo, Bayo, tell me how can this be?
You arrest the girls for turning tricks
But you're scared of Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee is a madman and he shot my Billy D
Bayo go get him or give the job to me
Delia DeLions, dear sweet Delia-D
How the hell can I arrest him? He's twice as big as me
Well don't ask me to go downtown, I won't come back alive 
Not only is that mother big but he packs a .45 
Bayo, Delia said, just give me a gun
He shot my Billy dead now I'm going to see him hung
She went into the DeLion's club through Billy DeLions blood
Stepped up to Stagger Lee at the bar
Said, ""Buy me a gin fizz, love.""
As Stagger Lee lit a cigarette she shot him in the balls
Blew the smoke off her revolver, had him dragged to city hall
Bayo, Bayo, see you hang him high
He shot my Billy dead and now he's got to die
Delia went a walking down on Singapore Street
A three-piece band on the corner played ""Near My God to Thee""
But Delia whistled a different tune, what tune could it be?
The song that woman sung was ""Look Out Stagger Lee""
The song that Delia sung was ""Look Out Stagger Lee"""

One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor


I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to  march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

Sittin' plush with a royal flush, aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line

Rock the boat, skin the goat

Wave that flag, wave it wide and high

Run your life, steal your wife

Reggae,Grateful Dead,1971,Skull and Roses,Me and My Uncle,"Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, West Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about half way
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, they's all around
Weed, liquor and money, they load it down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame;
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand


My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be

One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, lord he never saw
Shot me another, oh damn he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico

I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I loved my uncle, god rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road"

You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

Drink all day and rock all night
Law come to get you if you don't walk right
Got a letter this morning and all it read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks down under the bed
Then head back to Tennessee, Jed

Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog he turned to me and he said:

I woke up a-feeling mean
Went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned 'round and the letters read:

She takes me away to that special place
An' if I'd stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine


She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
An' pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you

What a kick, just a buddy and me
We had every big-shot goodtime band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race, got out of the place
Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change oh yeah

I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me

So please don't give me up, freedom

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind

How can a story never die?
It is love we must hold onto
Never easy, but we try
Sometimes our happiness is captured
Somehow, our time and place stand still
Love lives on inside our hearts and always will

Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

Maybe some moments weren’t so perfect
Maybe some memories not so sweet
But we have to know some bad times
Or our lives are incomplete
Then when the shadows overtake us
Just when we feel all hope is gone
We’ll hear our song and know once more
Our love lives on

How does a moment last forever?
How does our happiness endure?
Through the darkest of our troubles
Love is beauty, love is pure
Love pays no mind to desolation
It flows like a river through the soul
Protects, proceeds, and perseveres
And makes us whole

Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

How does a moment last forever
When our song lives on"

Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit ‘cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A

Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit!
A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
(Gunshot sounds)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

(Knocking sounds)
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open out!
Aww, shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
(Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

The verdict:
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the fuck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!"

Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos

Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forth-coming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor, better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the ""cha-pow!"" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
Like 69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki
A 5 minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right, you are not alone
Rock your hardhat, black, 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies, and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This New Math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme, you better learn how to add
It's mathematics

8-year-olds getting found with 9mils
It's 10 PM, where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill pumping krills to keep they bellies filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get cream
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin'
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business; no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your Zip Code, to SSI digits

Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good

Reach for the stars (It's all good)
You had a goal (C'mon)
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)
You had a goal
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well (Money)

Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel

Know you in heaven, smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you

Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)

Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break

Somebody tell me why
One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day

Every day that passes
Is a day that I get closer
Every move I make, every single day

Come on

You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

48 hours of love, It's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
Cause every second you’re away feels like forever

You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

Don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you were missing me
I’ll read between the lines and I sure hope it rains

Cole world (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (turn the overall volume up a lil bit, up a lil bit)
How's that? (yeah that’s nice)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep

I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep

Can't stop, yeah  (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)

Reggae,Dixie Chicks,2002,Home ,Travelin’ Soldier,"Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said ""would you mind sitting down for a while
And talking to me? I'm feeling a little low""
She said ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go""

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said ""I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said ""when it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down on the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said 'folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead""
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home"

When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
Come through dig the sound
I swear the whole world could feel you MC
Crowd around

I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails tied in bobbalobs
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strap
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take ""Means to the End"" for two milli'
""Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac

On Doomsday!, ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?

I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition ""super-villain"": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown

On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?

Doomsday
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back to the essence
Read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?

Pass the mic like ""Pass the peas like they used to say""
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames of nimble and tip of nipple metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!

Reggae,André 3000,2003,The Love Below,A Life in the Day of Benjamin André (Incomplete),"I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like, ""Yeah, nigga, right""
But you gave me your number anyway, you were on the talcum
Powder—how's about them oranges?
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a Mission Impo–ssible
We were both the same age, but I
Suppose wasn't on the same page, but in
The same book of life, so I'd page you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head I'm thinking, ""Cool""
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley
If your hometown would be heaven or hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
You'd dropped me off by the Dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
""Now are these niggas in this house up to something
Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?""
W-W-W-Well, yes and no
Yes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled, ""Ho!""
Meanwhile, the video starts playing
BET, college radio, and a van
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear, you know what I'm saying
But, I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam-roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home
But, when I got home, I never did
By the time I did, heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur who replied, ""See you later""
When he got the good news; that's life, shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque, but I'm living with my pop-pop
So I got a Glock and a LoJack
You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much 'cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more, follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you, tell me, then I'll double back
But keep in mind, at the time ""keep it real"" was the phrase
Silly once said now, but those were the days
When Spring Break, and Daytona, and Freakniks
Made you wanna drop out of college and never go back
Move to the South, but that ain't a Kodak
Moment, on went myself and Big Boi
Well, you knew him as 'Twan
That's right, you were around before this shit begun
When 'Twan had a daughter and
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like Jack
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some Yak
Girls used to say, ""Y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?""
And I'd laugh and they'd just keep smiling
""No, I'm from Atlanta, baby, he from Savannah, maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down, hey, we
Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes""
She's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants
15-love, fit like glove
Description is like fifteen doves
In a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose, agree?
Enough about me, how's about you? How's the lil' kid?
She was about two the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note
Now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see, I'd balled out, and 'fore I'd fall out
I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain was that fried egg I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor, staring
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
Yes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread, never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet Muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas
And macaroni niggas, imposters
So on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now you know her as Erykah ""On and On"" Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone, ""Why you
Do that girl like that, boy? You ought to be ashamed""
The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name
We're young, in love, in short we had fun
No regrets, no abortion, had a son
By the name of Seven, and he's five
By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six
You do the arithmetic, me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded, we throw the darts
To poke you in the heart and take you from the start
To when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays
Mama or her daddy let her borrow the Benz, because she's smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
You fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims, you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
And that's as far as I got
(*music fades*)

And that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go
Knowing the whole summer that's all you could think about
Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up
You need a jump, like your need and your want to grow
And you change all the time
So that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer
The next summer, you didn't want that Rabbit no more
You wanted something bigger and better
""So the summer passed and now the Rabbit's old?""
Right... right, so now you want a Cadillac..."

Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

Reggae,Dr. Dre,1999,2001,Forgot About Dre,"Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me ‘cause I can finally afford
To provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio
And it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales weren't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me
And turn me back to the old me

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk

But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs
Tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
‘Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
‘Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, ‘cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Da-da-da

We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far

What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

We are problems that want to be solved
We are children that need to be loved
We were willin', we came when you called
But man, you fooled us, enough is enough, oh

What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

Sticks and stones, they may break these bones
But then I'll be ready, are you ready?
It's the start of us, waking up come on
Are you ready? I'll be ready
I don't want control, I want to let go
Are you ready? I'll be ready
'Cause now it's time to let them know
We are ready, what about us?

What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
So what about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?

What about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?

Reggae,Machine Gun Kelly & Camila Cabello,2016,Catch Feels,Bad Things,"Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated"
Reggae,Diddy,1997,No Way Out,I’ll Be Missing You,"Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit don't mean nothing
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you B.I.G
Can't wait 'til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day, when I see your face again

Yeah, this right here (Tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you
(I miss you B.I.G.)

It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven, smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

Somebody tell me why
One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every day that passes
Is a day that I get closer
Every move I make, every single day
To seeing you again
We miss you B.I.G
Every night I pray, every step I take
And we won't stop
'Cause we can't stop
Every move I make, every single day
That's right
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
We miss you B.I.G

Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (We miss you)

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (I'll be missin' you)
Thinkin' of the day (Thinkin' of the day) when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (We miss you)"
Reggae,Hayce Lemsi,2013,Électron Libre,One-One,"Je recherche la forme et le fond, j'observe la flore et la faune
Sous l'effet d'la fleur, de la sueur sur le front, l'Eldorado n'est pas en forme d'hexagone
Hegoune, t'as des preuves avant d'm'inculper ? Trop fier pour faire mon mea culpa
J'attends pas que la France nous vire à coups d'pied pour capter qu'elle ne nous écoute pas
Je n'oublie pas que chaque minute est chère et j'ai peur de périr sans chahed
Dans mes veines d'Algérien jihen coule du sang de moudjahed
J'ai mon public à chérir mais il est possible que demain j'arrête
Tous les soirs j'suis déchiré, j'reprends les ients-cli qu't'as chehel
J'arrive avec deux barres sur la paire de Fred, deux barres juste après le XV
Deux barres sur l'uniforme de c't'enculé de képi que j'viens d'gifler
Deux barres de fer dans le coffre de la tchop, cesse de t'plaindre, on a pas de tié-pi
Rien qu'tu grattes les p'tits ça m'choque, Paname c'est pas l'Éthiopie

Ton calibre risque de s'enrayer, face à la Kalash tah Poutine
MC Lemsi te piétine, t'en oublies tes disque de platine
Parti d'un beat et de quelques lettres, je me démène pour celle qui m'a fait naître
Ils sont à la porte, Fouzia jette la selha par la fenêtre
Biko foulek, ça gère un tas d'poulettes
J'allais dans les studios, j'kickais tous les rappeurs, survet', plein d'trous d'boulettes
Wesh l'ancien t'es bourré ? Sur n'importe quelle prod j'te prends
Essaye pas de rivaliser, t'avais mon âge à l'époque des francs
Elegant, éloquent, y a qu'les putes qui changent de camp
Ma cagoule me va comme un gant, j'sors en indé' comme un grand
Rien qu'tu trembles, t'as besoin d'une paire de couilles, pas d'un entrainement
Tu t'manges des baffes en province, viens pas sur Paris faire de l'entertainment

On vend d'la zipette pour faires des emplettes, attraper de belles bitchs, pas d'baraque au bled
Moi j'suis parano mec, j'suis pas renommé, à part pour la monnaie, j'suis pas malhonnête

J'vais niquer des reu-mé, tu vas pas m'reconnaitre
J'ai rien à espérer, rien à promettre
Nul n'est à l'abri d'une rafale dans les pommettes
De finir à Fleury, Fresnes, aux Baumettes
Passez pas la pommade, j'vais devenir vulgaire
J'voulais juste une limonade et des chiennes de guerre
Comme un pointeur en promenade rentre sous terre
Sur Paname ramène pas tes textes de merde
